397-Making It
===

[00:00:00] Bob: Two million subscribers? Oh yeah. What? Two million. That's it. I don't know how that happened. Did you, did you come home and like, your house was like full of flowers and there's just money stacked on all the tables and stuff? Yeah. The 

[00:00:14] Jimmy: cats all had party hats on. All five cats. Awesome. Good. 

[00:00:18] Bob: That's it.

That's what it was like for me, too. 

[00:00:22] Jimmy: No, I was I was in the middle of sewing the wallets when I got a message from Adam, my guy who handles most of the web stuff, and he just said woohoo, and he had a screen grab of 2 million. And it's funny because I was talking with a couple friends like, man, you might hit like 2 million like in the next couple of weeks, and it was that same day.

And it was just like a couple of hours later. I would have needed like, I I don't know what's going on. I'm not gonna complain. I got to complain for something that's too good. What is there to complain about? Nothing. All of these people. I don't know what's going on. I've added, like if you see my bar graph, like I don't know if I sent it to you guys.

When you look at my overall views from the beginning of time till now, you know, like 2015 to like 2018, like there's all peaks because that's where everything was the most viewed, right? Then it dips down from like 2019 till now where it's like nothing. And then it's as high as it's ever been ever. In the last two weeks.

Wow. It's crazy. I, I, pretty sure it's, you know when they tell you, like, congratulations, this video is getting more views than usual, and uh, someone's calling me, your video is getting more views than usual for this, that, or the other reason. And it says because you've been posting more often and you're putting up more content.

And that's primarily, I think, the shorts, because I'm still, my long form is still the regular schedule every Saturday, or at least mostly every Saturday, and the shorts are at least one a day. So. And that's because the website team is putting up a short every day, and some of the shorts are getting like...

One of them's got almost 7 million views and it's the bandsaw letter P and I think it's the shorts that are, and I was talking with Jackman yesterday and he said the same thing. He says he's getting all of his subscribers, all of his new subscribers are all coming in from the shorts. All of his shorts are popping off or a lot of the, you know, there's like four or five shorts that pop off and same with me.

Like the top three or four shorts are getting lots and lots of views. And that's where all the subscribers are coming from. So, YouTube's master plan seems to be coming into effect. 

[00:02:29] Bob: Well, I mean,

I have a question, but I don't want to, like, go too far into the YouTube stuff, like, uh, too deep, but Is that, or could you see that turning into something measurable financially, or? With like actual growth, so I don't know if we talked about this, but like the hollow view thing is one thing I worry about with the 

[00:02:53] Jimmy: shorts.

The shorts are monetized now. I don't know if it's up to the same amount. No, I'm sure it's not. But, I mean, it's not nothing. Yeah. You know, and then... It's close to nothing. 

[00:03:05] David: It's really close to nothing, no. 

[00:03:07] Jimmy: But, but, but honestly, you know, I can go back, we can all go back to advertisers now and say, look at how many views I'm getting.

And then ask them for more money. 

[00:03:16] David: I think the important thing though is that they translate into subscribers, which then translates into views on the long form content. Yeah. And, which it seems to be working since your subscriber count is way up now. 

[00:03:28] Jimmy: And I'm getting lots and lots of, uh, I'm getting lots and lots of comments on old videos, so...

Oh, okay. Like, for instance, the barn video that Taylor and I put up is... I'm getting a lot of comments on that. And when I look down, there's a couple of older videos that seem to be in the top list, which haven't gotten attention in a long time. I can't remember exactly which ones. 

[00:03:49] David: It's weird. Every once in a while, like a bunch of the old videos would just start to pop off and I'll get all these comments on these old videos and I don't know how to answer the questions if there's like a legit question and then no views on the old videos for a long time.

And then a couple of weeks later, you know, there's like 10 comments on old, like super old videos. 

[00:04:10] Bob: Yeah, that is strange. I mean, we, I've seen that a couple of times, not, I don't see it on a regular basis, but, I don't know what causes that. I'm not sure. I've been 

[00:04:20] David: getting a few, are you the drunken woodworker guy?

You look like the guy in the video. So, I've been getting that lately, which is fun. 

[00:04:28] Bob: What do you say? Like, no, that's my cousin? No. 

[00:04:32] David: Uh, yeah, I'd just say that, that was me. Say he's dead 

[00:04:34] Jimmy: to me. Don't ever bring his name up again. I just did a 

[00:04:38] David: pretty good job of answering a lot of questions in the comments. 

[00:04:44] Bob: Oh yeah, dang, that graph is significant.

It's crazy, right? 

[00:04:48] Jimmy: I'll post it on Instagram this week. 

[00:04:51] Bob: Wow. That's pretty wild. Well, congratulations on two million and I'm glad that those, all those views are going up. That's fantastic. 

[00:05:02] Jimmy: Thank you, thank you. It's exciting. Now I could actually say, because everybody, like, everybody would introduce me like, oh this is Jimmy.

He's got two million subscribers. I'm like, I actually have like one million eight hundred thousand. I don't really have two you know, I could have to say that to everybody. Because people would always introduce me like that. 

[00:05:17] Bob: Does seeing some like positive growth and some you know the graphs going upward does that give you some motivation or does that change anything I mean uh 

[00:05:28] Jimmy: yeah I definitely I was about to say no but it does it gives you a little bit more like okay I can't wait to show the new subscribers This upcoming project or hopefully they stick along and watch, you know, the house project, which we're going to talk about and I started the pool table yesterday, too.

I haven't shown any of that. I'll show that today on Instagram, but I'm doing an exploratory build on the pool table just to understand how the pockets get installed. So I went and bought some just scrap. Well, I say scrap, but I went and bought some wood that will not be the final wood for the. Pool table, just so I could understand the whole setup for the pocket so that when I go and use walnut and maple, I'm not wasting the wood or making an inaccurate cut.

So I could make that inaccurate cut now, and then have templates to work off of. So that's what I'm doing, I'm making all the rails out of, uh, just some cheaper wood. So I'm working on that, and I'm excited now to show it, whereas in... I'm thinking like, okay, the channel's dying, uh, I guess I'll still make this boat.

You know, the core fans, the core fans that have supported all of us all this time are going to come and watch it and, and it's good enough. It's good enough. You're not 

[00:06:35] David: dramatic at all.

[00:06:39] Jimmy: But honestly, it's, it's like, okay, all right, good, now I got some good content coming up. I got this, I got a, you know, truck restoration I'm working on, I got the house restoration I'm working on, and the pool table. So three big builds for the summer, then I got to start working on my go kart, you know, so I'm excited.

It's motivating me to be able to show off some fun stuff. 

[00:06:57] David: Are you doing all these builds as one video, or are you going to break them up? 

[00:07:02] Jimmy: Uh, the pool table will be one video, and the house obviously will be a series. 

[00:07:07] David: Series do so well. I'm trying to 

[00:07:09] Jimmy: work on getting the series going. Well, it has to be because there's so many, like for instance, the sill plate is rotted and the corner of the house is rotted and it's not in a major, major way.

It's not like I have to replace the sill plate around the entire footprint of the house. It's just like two feet in one direction and like four feet in the other direction. And there's probably other trouble spots, but this definitely is the worst trouble spot because it's the deepest part of the house that's sunken the most.

That alone could be its own standalone video. And then the introductory video, and then just videos on the, on the graveyard itself. And I wish I could remember his name offhand, I'd have to look at my, my DMs. But there's a gentleman who restores gravestones, and he and I have been in touch. He's very popular on TikTok.

And a few people have sent him to me, but we were already in touch. And he's like, I'm looking forward, he's going to come to New York State and explore some graveyards. And he definitely wants to come and check out mine. That's going to be cool. Yeah, so there's lots of content there, there's a lot to chew on, which is why when me and Howard were looking at the place, I'm like, it's not perfect, I'm sure there's problems with it that we can't see right now, like when we pull off the plastic insulation on the foundation, and like, oh, there is no foundation there, ah, I see.

[00:08:18] Bob: So I have a question about the graveyard, I didn't even think about this. You were doing stone carving last week for the Makers Central sign. Is that, I mean, was pursuing that related to the graveyard about, you know, like, Improving the old stones or anything like that? No, 

[00:08:31] Jimmy: no, no. I've been wanting to play with...

There's a, there's a, um... An Instagrammer who, I'll remember her name in a minute, um, but she still carves stone, and she does these incredibly geometric, precise stone carvings. She's a British artist, and she's very well, well established, and she's not just some quirky crafts person, she really, really does these incredible works of art, and she has a gallery and stuff, and I've been watching her and she makes it look so easy.

What, what her skill set is, obviously is stone carving, but her geometric patterns are just bananas. And they look like computer drawings when she's done. Her precision is just top notch. And so following her has inspired me to try it. And then when I started carving the Maker Central logo, it naturally did a v carve.

I'm just mentioning that. And I just went into it. Her name is Zoe. I just kept doing it and, and I actually posted and I thanked her for her inspiration, but. The graveyard just coincided with that. But now I have a better, greater appreciation for looking at these stones and realizing that most of them, a lot of them are hand carved.

There are some that are just like farmer made. I showed a couple of them online where it's just guy probably buried somebody he knows alone. Probably a murder, buried somebody he knows alone. Busted out a stone and a chisel and a hammer and just made like here lies, you know, jebediah, blah blah, blah, 

[00:09:56] Bob: blah, 17, seven.

I did not murder this person. . Yeah, it says at the bottom of 

[00:10:00] Jimmy: everywhere on, on a random shaped stone. Not even something that has like a interesting, has a geometric shape to it.

That's cool. So yeah, no, it's exciting. It's definitely exciting and it definitely has me renewed. I was working on the pool table last night and once I say it all the time, once you get started on something that's been daunting. It's like you take that first step, literally, physically, metaphorically, you take that first step and you start walking, and then all of a sudden you're like, okay, I'm over this, the hump, the hump of getting started.

And now I'm started, and I'm actually looking forward to going out there and solving the problems of how the pockets intersect with the railings and so on and so on. So, I got started and it feels good, feels really good. 

[00:10:47] Bob: Great. Good. Yeah. But David, what are you up to? 

[00:10:55] David: Uh, making chairs, still. So, tomorrow, Thursday, A couple days ago for you listeners, I am putting out the chair build video.

We took a, we found this little Goodwill kids chair and decided to make it adult size. And then I had another folding chair that we already had a wooden folding chair that's from the seventies and I kind of used that for inspiration and made this chair. And we were all surprised, by we, I mean, my brother and I, that it actually worked.

And so that video's coming out tomorrow. I decided to make plans for it. So I shot another video for the second channel that's more of a step by step, instead of me experimenting and trying to figure it out. So, this week we shot that video, and there'll be plans for it. It's, it's, um... It's one of the most satisfying projects I've ever made.

I didn't expect that to happen, but just because it's got some moving parts and it folds up nice and it looks, it looks nice, it's, it's just so satisfying. Especially thinking the whole time we were making the prototype one, kept saying like this isn't, this isn't gonna work, it's just a prototype, we're gonna learn from it, and then we'll redo it, and then it was like 99 percent correct, and it was just.

It was, it was, I, I, I can't put it in words how excited I was when it, when it actually worked. 

[00:12:18] Bob: Wouldn't you? That's awesome. Yeah. I know that feeling. I mean, when you're just really not expecting something to, to work and then, especially when it has moving parts. I don't know. There's something about that.

Yeah. Like a mechanism, you know. Yeah. Not just being, but doing is, there's something really, really cool about that. That's awesome. It's 

[00:12:34] David: funny. So, when you're genuinely excited, it always, it feels, so here's, here, here's the thing about me. I don't like opening Christmas presents up in front of family. I don't like people watching my excitement.

When people give me a 

[00:12:53] Jimmy: card, I always like, do you want me to open this now, or later? So I can appreciate it. Because I don't want to open it in front of them, because they're like, ah, ah, ah, 

[00:13:01] David: ah. I don't, yeah, I don't like putting on the show. I don't like the, I, I, I don't enjoy the reaction part of it. People watching the reaction.

It does, because it, I might be excited, but maybe I'm not showing enough excitement or I might not be excited and I got to fake the excitement. And I do, I, we, we, we have normal, Gift things, and 

[00:13:25] Bob: I do the thing. We have the gift curtain in our house, and we pull the curtain back and open the gifts 

[00:13:30] Jimmy: behind it.

The gift curtain of shame. That's right. So, shooting the video, I, 

[00:13:37] David: um, you know. It feels like, oh, I'm watching the video, and I'm feeling like, oh, I'm going through those same feelings. Like, I'm showing my actual excitement on camera, but it's weird. Is it, does, it kind of feels fake even though that it's real, so it's, it's one of those.

Ah, I live in my head way too 

[00:13:56] Bob: much. Me too, man. Me too. Uh, I, I, I go through that same kind of thing on camera about, like, I just don't want to act. Yeah. I don't, I mean, people act for a living. I feel like for a living. There's nothing wrong with acting, but it's just, I don't want to in any way whatsoever.

And I'm always really resistant anytime that there's like a, you know, if we do something and then we have to do it again, and I kind of lose the initial, you know. Improvisation of it, I'm like, oh, like, now I have to act like it's the first time that I did this whatever, or, you know, the team has tried to get me to kind of do skit type things, you know, for the story, which there's nothing wrong with that, but it's like, there's something in me that's always really resistant to that type of thing, and I don't want to seem fake or, Something.

[00:14:50] David: But you, you, you might, you might practice something off camera and you're like, yes, that works. And then you already know that it works. And so then when you do the thing on camera, you, you feel like you have to have the same reaction, but it's not the same reaction. 

[00:15:06] Bob: So yeah. Yeah. 

[00:15:09] Jimmy: I was gonna say, if we celebrate 400 episodes and we do like something where we dress up like women, Bob, you not in?

[00:15:19] Bob: Yeah, I mean, we'll do that at the live, at the Making It 400 

[00:15:24] Jimmy: live event that we're planning. Bob just turned red when I suggested that.

Yeah, we'll do like a, you know, like a 80s comedy thing. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, dressing up like a woman was always the punchline. 

[00:15:37] David: What was the, what was the, the one show with the comedians and the crowd would shout out things for them to, to do. And they had What's my line? Whose line? What's my line? Yeah, whose lines it?

Anyway, that's, that's making it 400 and that's all it is. Oh, that would 

[00:15:49] Jimmy: be fun. . That would be 

[00:15:51] Bob: fun. Oh man. I have a feeling the three of us would be terrible at like stage improv, . 

[00:15:57] David: Oh 

[00:15:57] Bob: yeah. Oh, man. Okay. Yeah. Well, we'll do that for our giant 400 episode event that nobody knows about and so nobody's going to be there and we'll accidentally forget to record it.

Uh, for me, last week has been just like the previous week. I've been working on the same stuff, still working on the stairs, uh, actually I have the stairs installed now and they look really, really nice, so, that, at least it's usable, you know, a usable staircase. I don't have the lights in place, um, but I do have it figured out, I think.

But the reason I don't have it in place is because I've also been working on, uh, My small part of this big trade show booth thing that we're building, Josh has been building this whole big booth setup for us, and I've just had some Arduino programming to do for kind of an interactive display element, and so especially the last couple days, but I've just been working on all of that stuff, trying to get it all wired up and test it and, you know, make it compact and make it to where we can move it and make it to where we can hook it up and, like, take it down, all that type of stuff.

And then I had to build, I don't know if I told you all this, I had to build a... A carrier for R2 D2. A carrier? Yeah. Like a shipping crate? Well, not, like a dolly kind of thing. 

[00:17:19] Jimmy: Oh, yeah, yeah, because you got to roll them around like a 55 gallon drum 

[00:17:22] Bob: kind of? Yeah, so we're taking R2 D2 to this educational trade show thing we're doing, and as like a, just a way to get people's attention, and he's a good example of Fusion stuff and Arduino stuff, and people who take their droids to, you know, events and stuff all the time, they have these certain types of, um, like, carriers for them, because they're, they're strong, but they're also kind of fragile in certain ways, you know, just depending on how you're moving them and holding them and...

Um, unless you build one that's just metal, through and through, you know, it's, it's, it has weaker materials in certain places. So, I've had to figure that out, and I've done it in the simplest way possible that would make it easy to move, but it's just a weird thing to, to think about. You know, it's like having to take this big droid and turn it into, yeah, I mean like turn it into something that can lay on its back and not fall apart, and has to be able to be moved upright and on its back, and like you have to be able to carry it, you have to be able to roll it, and it's super simple, it's not like a complicated device, but just trying to think through how the weight is gonna, when it's on its back.

The weight's gonna be pulling on it, all the different joints and stuff, differently. So, how do I support it? So it just took a little, little thought. 

[00:18:43] David: Now that it's gonna be in public, are you doing any last minute refinements to it? 

[00:18:49] Bob: Uh, no changes. I did open it up and... Reattach a bunch of stuff that had been disconnected for different reasons, and, um, I kind of ran through it all again, and, like, reinforced some connections, because there's a lot of connections that are just header pins poked into things, and just from being jostled around, those can fall out, and then stuff will not work, and you don't really have any idea why, so I kind of made a bunch of connectors to make things more stable connections, but other than that, No, I just didn't have time to add functionality to it.

And honestly, for like, for a kid that doesn't expect to see a life size R2 D2, to walk up and see an R2 D2, it really does not have to do very much for them to be blown away. If it makes noise and lights up, you know, that's enough. And if it moves, they're like, what? Like, it's, it's crazy. We had, um, some neighbors, there's a few girls that live down the street, and I didn't realize they were Star Wars fans, but they came over to play with our kids one time.

And so they're walking. Through our living room, they walk around the kitchen, and then there's this R2 D2 that's almost bigger than they are. And one of them just lost her mind. She was like, I don't understand, what, how did this, who, where did this, you know, and I'm like, would you want me to turn 

[00:20:04] Jimmy: it on?

He's retired from show business, he lives here now. 

[00:20:06] Bob: Yeah, I'm like, do you want me to turn it on? She's like, what do you mean? I'm like, it'll light up, and I can drive it around and stuff. She's like, what? And so she, then on like, Halloween, she dressed up as Princess Leia, and she wanted to come over and take pictures with R2 D2 and stuff like that.

So, it, it makes a really big impact, even without, like, every panel opening and, you know, doing all the stuff, so. 

[00:20:26] David: As, as a casual Star Wars fan, especially the episodes, what, four, five, and, and six, um, Seeing the actual, when we went to a Maker Faire eight, seven years ago, and seeing actual R2 D2s moving around, that was mind blowing to me, as an adult, and only as a casual fan.

Like, it was, they're really impressive. 

[00:20:50] Jimmy: They're definitely impressive when you see them in person. They're always a little bit bigger than you expect them to be. Yeah, 

[00:20:53] Bob: yeah. Yeah, we had a comment the other day on YouTube, actually, on like the last R2 video, which was two years ago or something. And it was like, why did you make it?

Oh wait, what was it? It was, why did you make it so big? Either that or you're a really tiny man . And I was like, well, I mean, it could be both of those things, but also I made it like exact size. If you remember it was made to put a person in, like there used to be a dude who got inside the thing and moved it around, you know?

So I think people just don't realize how big they are. 'cause they're. Pretty big. 

[00:21:28] Jimmy: At the show, make sure he has a lanyard on. Put like a like, you know, if you guys are all wearing lanyards, make sure he has a lanyard, his own lanyard, whatever the show. We were 

[00:21:35] Bob: talking about that. We'd have to like, make a super long one though to go around his giant head.

Um, but anyway, so I've been working on getting that, that kind of cart thing. Um. And you know, it's basically just like a plywood L with a spine down that follows his contour because he's, he's kind of at an angle. And so it has like a support spine so he's in contact with the whole thing and then that's covered with foam and then, um, you know, there's like strapping points and handles cut into the kind of L shape.

It's not complicated but it was just one of those things I had to spend time on over the last week just to get it done. Um, and I'm really hoping that it all fits in our vehicle, like we, you know, like Josh has been building this setup so that it breaks down into sheets and we can stack it all. But he's like a R2D2, not Josh, R2D2 is like a 30 by 30 by 45, like, cube, like a pretty big cube.

Box of thing to like, you know, put inside of a vehicle. So we'll see but that's Today we have to load up and get all ready for that When is the show exactly? It starts tomorrow. So we're leaving early in the morning driving down and we have to we have to drive in Have it like a 10 minute window to unload And then go set it all up and then the show starts like an hour later or something.

Will this show be 

[00:23:03] Jimmy: like equal in size to say for instance like the first Maker Central we've all been to? Like 

[00:23:07] Bob: that type of footprint? I honestly have no idea. It's at a pretty big event center. Um, but I've never been to one of these types of things so I don't, I really don't know. We'll see how it goes. I mean it could be, uh, It could be a really good thing or it could just be a learning experience.

Or maybe both, you know, but it could be one of those things where we've put in time and effort and we get down there and realize it's just not the right place. It's not the right crowd. It's not the right product. It's, you know. So you're wondering 

[00:23:38] David: if the investment is worth it. 

[00:23:42] Bob: Yes, and as far as segues go, that was fantastic.

That was very good. 

[00:23:47] Jimmy: That was very good. I think Dave's got something to do. He's like, let's get to it. 

[00:23:53] Bob: So what you're saying is we should wrap the show up right now. So we were talking about, um, uh, Craig. Was it Craig that came up? Yeah, Craig Bays. Yeah, what was his original, his original suggestion? I think, 

[00:24:06] Jimmy: have we invested time and energy in any skills that were vaguely useless?

Yeah. Or maybe a waste of, waste of energy? I think if we have it right, Craig, I think 

[00:24:14] Bob: that's what you said. Yeah. So, I mean, I think we could expand that out a little bit to just bad investments. Like, where have we put time, money, um, effort, thought, whatever, into something that just didn't pan out or didn't...

You know, it wasn't worthwhile. Um, either as a cautionary tale for other people, or just, I think sometimes, I, I know that I've put time and effort into things that just turned out not to be my thing. Like, it just, you know, I have, I have skills in some places that are just better than others. And so, like, I don't have to do all things.

So, anybody got any, any specific events of a bad investment? I remember 

[00:24:56] Jimmy: buying, I bought the Cadillac, the 1967 Cadillac for my birthday about three years ago, four years ago, just before the pandemic, I guess it was. I still get people asking me, how's the Cadillac coming along? I gave that, I gave that, I was about to curse, I gave that away because when I started digging into it, I was just like, Oh man, this is going to take so much time and so much energy.

I mean, I wasn't trying to make it a perfect restoration, but I was like, I'm putting so much time and energy into this. And as far as investments go, it was 1, 200. So it wasn't that big of a deal. For some cool photography that I got hanging around with it and having fun with it. But every time I went to it I had to try and jump start it and it started and the timing was off and I was just not good with the engine stuff and so I just gave, I gave it away to my friend Mike.

Just, you could have it. And having made what I guess you could call a bad investment buying the car and then the stress and trouble of moving it around because it was right in the middle of stuff at the racetrack and then we had to do, we did the racetrack event and then had to move the car and then on that particular day I just said to my friend Mike, I'm like, do you want this?

I said, I got to get the hell out of here. That was like. Alleviating so much stress for me because I was like, I bought this thing. I got this thing. I got the fans invested in it. Now I have to actually follow through with it. But then when I just literally cut the limb off and let it go, instead of trying to keep saving it, I was like, that's nice.

Okay. Let me just put my time and energy into something else. And I've been able to do that from time to time. Just dip out of a bad investment, big or small. I get to a point where I'm just like, you know what? I've invested enough time and energy into this. I just. Don't have the heart for it. And maybe the financial, financial investment as well.

But we were joking about bad investments and last night on my Instagram stories I was showing off the new house and how I uncovered a pretty a pretty serious foundation flaw but... It's an old house and it's like the number one thing that goes wrong with old houses is this foundation, sill plate goes bad.

Well, the foundation, stack stone foundation and the sill plate go bad. It's, it's like literally keeping your feet in the mud for 200 years and expecting everything to stay dry and clean. And digging into that. When you buy a house and the three of us own houses and you know what it's like when you buy it, you're like, Oh man, that's amazing.

Did I just make a huge mistake? Oh my God, it's so exciting. Did I just make the stupidest thing decision I'll ever make in my life? You go back and forth on that for months and you're still like, I'm in the house now 19 years. I'm like, did I make a bet? And now by now, I know I'm totally cool, but it takes months, if not years to get past that feeling of like.

You're waiting for like that gut punch of like, Oh, yep, nope, the house is completely infested with, you know, some, some beetles. So the whole house has to be taken down. You're like, you're waiting for like that one shoe to drop every time. Same if you buy a used car. It's, is the transmission going to go any minute?

It's always that gut feeling, but I like to always take the approach when, when you invest in a physical thing like a house or a car or a big car like that or something, I always like to take the approach of everything is fixable. It's just, will this fix ruin me financially? And you hope not. And you try to make the best decisions so that you don't get ruined financially.

And if it is a choice of. Oh, this is going to ruin me financially if I have to fix it now. Can I incrementally fix it and slowly ease into the problem and slowly start to develop a plan to, to, to make this what feels like a bad investment, a good investment. And you know, we, we have a, a, a, we have a fortunate situation where like any, even if it's a bad investment, we could turn it into content like.

A bad investment, like buying a house with a rotted sill plate. It's like what Laura did. Laura's like going to have to replace that whole entire house frame by the time she's done. And it's probably not the most profitable endeavor, but she's reaping rewards in other ways. New subscribers and views and, you know, all that translates to ultimately more money when you partner up with any tool company for whatever reason.

So, ultimately, everything is content. Good or bad.

[00:29:12] Bob: Yeah, I, I think like, on the car thing specifically, I mean, I felt that, I've wondered about that recently with both of my project vehicles, you know. I got the, excuse me, I got the Karmagia to a point, and then, I'm like, well, did it, is it a bad investment because I ruined it? You know, did I, did I bite off more than I can chew, and then did I just cause this to be...

Everything is fixable. No, I agree with you, but in the moment, I was like, you know, did I, did I ruin this? Did I turn what could have been a good investment and could have been like a fun thing to do into something that's like you can't come back from? I don't think I did. But, that was definitely something that I ran into.

Similarly, on the Land Cruiser, on the green one. Um, I, one of the reasons I got that one, knowing that it's body, the lower half of it's body was really rotten, like all throughout, like it's got steel plate. Welded into the floor to replace the body or it's like over top of it. There's holes in the floorboard that go all the way through.

When I bought it, I was okay with that because I knew that there's a company that sold the entire bottom body. Like the, if you just cut the thing in half, the bottom half of it, you can buy this entire tub as a single piece. Welded aluminum to the original specifications like you can buy one they'll ship it to you It's like four or five thousand dollars, and it just bolts on so you can you can completely replace that whole thing at one time So that was my you know I'm gonna take a lower cost vehicle because I know that I'm gonna invest that much into it at some point down the road Whatever well found out at the beginning of this year that company which is super well known for doing that that company that has sold tons of them, and everybody relies on them, decided that they're retiring at the end of this year.

Oh, I remember you mentioned them then. They're not going to make any more of that, so... of those bodies. And so, then I, you know, in the last couple of months, I've been like, Are you in the window? 

[00:31:14] Jimmy: Are you in the waiting 

[00:31:15] Bob: list? I mean, no, I haven't ordered one yet because I don't need it. I don't have a place to put it.

I don't have four or five grand to drop on a thing that is just going to sit in a, you know, barn for a while. And so, now I'm like, well, I mean, did I? Did I just assume that that would always be available and, you know, did I, did I make a bad investment there on getting this vehicle that there are other options to fix it in the same way.

They're just way more expensive and they're not as tried and true and, you know. So, I don't know. I don't know about that one. Even the same thing on the white cruiser. I put down money, I bought another engine to keep this thing alive. I put down money to have it worked on and that was 11 months ago. And so, the last couple of months has been me going, well, I mean, like, maybe I should have just bought a new car, like, but I've already, I've already, I'm in the sunk cost thing, where I've already put money down, you know, to cut and run on that, would just, I would lose that money, and I still wouldn't have a vehicle.

And, yeah, so I'm kind of stuck with cars, specifically, feeling like maybe I've made bad investments. And maybe not. We'll see how they pan out. But, you know, when things get stalled, or things go really wrong, or things are out of your control, I think that's one of the big things, is when, uh, the Ghia, I feel pretty confident, that eventually, with enough time, I can bring it back around.

[00:32:37] Jimmy: The good thing about the cars you bought, you bought cars that are... sought after, no matter what. 

[00:32:42] Bob: Yeah, and they're very known. There's lots of parts for all of these. That's what I'm saying. 

[00:32:45] Jimmy: You could turn around and sell them straight away to somebody that's in the same category as you that's, wants to do it, but just loves those cars.

You probably wouldn't lose. But at the end of the day... You do what you do what you enjoy. So technically speaking, like for instance, this house, technically speaking, maybe at the moment it's a bad investment, but if there's another real estate spike that there was up here, I could turn around and sell it as is right now and definitely increase my investment.

But in general, you do it because you love it. You do it because you want to do it. 

[00:33:18] Bob: I think the intent of, of the investment matters too. So, yeah. If your intent is to get content out of it, like you said, it can be good or bad content. It can be, you know, it can work or not work and still be content. If your intent is to invest in something to have the experience of it or learn something specific, but not necessarily come out the other end with a finished thing, that can have value.

Like, I've learned way more about cars than I would have just hoping and dreaming that someday I'll get a car. Even if they stay...

So, I mean, the intent there is on me. It's not necessarily about having a showroom of old cars that I fixed up that I can look at. You know, it's about learning about them and driving them, hopefully. David, what do you have? Do you have anything like this? 

[00:34:10] David: Weirdly enough, it's kind of similar to you guys. So, the one thing is...

I invested a lot of time and money into learning how to paint a car so I took a I paid for a whole course when I got when I got the Impala I took a whole course on painting it which was awesome a lot I learned a lot of stuff and then I invested a lot of money and the equipment that I needed plus the supplies I have all the paint the clear coat the primer everything and I haven't done anything with it in a year and a half And when I got the car, I was really excited to do all this work to it.

And then I realized that it's not where I wanted to focus my time at that particular... At this particular moment in time, it's not where I want to put my efforts. Because it's not going to... It's, it's not where, uh, it doesn't sound very fun right now and it doesn't help the business. Right? So I want to do things that are, so I have it.

I will probably eventually use it and it would be nice to have, I might have to go through the course again and kind of relearn some things, but, um, that was a lot of money and time and part of me wants to, just to make it so it looks good to go get a vinyl wrap. Not, not like, of my logo, or, or, like a Red Bull type vinyl wrap on the car, but just like a white.

But I 

[00:35:41] Bob: mean, putting your face on it, like all over, would be pretty cool. 

[00:35:45] David: Um, so there's, there's lots of like, oh, just, just go get a vinyl wrap as a temporary thing to make it look really good. Uh, and then paint it down the road. So there's that. Um, I, we're... Trying to invest a lot of time and money into a lakefront property that we want to turn into like a complete crazy looking getaway.

And we've been looking at properties for months now and can't find one in this particular area or we're, we tried to buy two. The first one we were like two hours too late to put a bid in. And then the other one we put it in, uh, for asking price and somebody came in above us and we're going to look at another property that is out of our range, out of our budget this Saturday, could be a waste of time, but I am absolutely scared about this because it could It could potentially make us money because we want to take this place and we want to turn it into a complete getaway like Pachudo style, mid century modern, a gal it'll be my own gallery of work and just like a complete flip and then do rentals and it's also would be a getaway for us and um I know, like, I know there's going to be so much, so many hidden costs.

Like, Oh yeah, of course we got to, we got to pay utilities. Oh, there's got to be security when nobody's there. We got to have somebody go and mow the lawn. If we can't do like, is all this, is this going to be worth my time? Or is this going to be the start of like, yeah, we're going to make a lot of money on this and let's build our real estate empire.

Um, so I'm super, super scared about that. And the funny thing is, it's like, I was talking to my buddy, we went to lunch last summer. He owns a bunch of properties and he was just like, it's worked out really well for him, where he's like, if it doesn't work, you just sell it. These properties that we're looking...

They were much cheaper two years ago and they're like, if we got this property and we wanted to sell it a year from now, would we take a huge loss? Right. And so that's, uh, that's kind of our mindset right now is. Is this, is this the right time? But, this is uh, but this is an investment into my business.

This is an investment into our future. I don't think this YouTube thing is gonna work forever. So, I wanna have real estate, I wanna have these other investments that could potentially make money after YouTube is done. But this is also going to be a whole series on my channel of taking this, taking a crappy cottage and turn it into a mid century modern getaway that's a gallery of my, of my work.

Um, so I'm super scared. 

[00:38:48] Bob: Yeah, I mean, it's understandable. I think with the type of property that you're looking at, one encouraging thing about that is that you've had Trouble buying one. Oh, yeah, which means that you would not have trouble selling one now Whether that's at a loss or not will depend on timing and yeah market and stuff like that But they sell quick I think even even if you were you know to get into a place where a couple years down the road you had to sell It and you had to sell it at a loss there's Given any situation.

There's something to be said for even Getting out of it, stopping the long term bleeding for short term bleeding, and having to like, pay off the difference, and you know what I mean? Then you have a known factor of like, this is now what we're left with that we have to figure out how to pay off. Rather than just like, we have a piece of property that we cannot get rid of, and we're just going to continue to pay on it forever and ever and ever.

I mean, that's one of the dangers. But I think, with the location, or the type of property that you're talking about, that seems like that would be... Kind of a plus, you know, as far as how, how much, how hard it is for you to get one right now. But, I mean, I've thought about property as well. And I don't, I'm not worried so much about it being a bad investment.

Uh, I think the timing is just, it's one of those things, just like the stock market where you go like, You know, a couple months ago would have been a great time to buy. X, you know? And then that time has passed and just, it's not going to be the same. You don't necessarily want to wait another ten years for like, you know, all the rates to go down and all the whatever's whatever's.

But, um, I wish that I had bought a rental property about a year ago. Just, I wish I had had the money to buy one a year ago and sit on it until I was ready to start, you know, like renovating or whatever. But I didn't. So I didn't so that's how I'm gonna keep 

[00:40:42] David: an eye out. Yeah, that's how investments go The thing is properties like they've always gone up in value over time It's like we've been studying investments like stock market property real estate for a while now and real estate over time has just Just like the stock market, as a whole, over time has gone up, so I think it's just a fear of change, because it's a thing that as soon as we buy this property, our lifestyle will instantly change.

We will now be on a major budget. We will now have a major time, uh, cons, constraints with, not constraints, but just limited time to do things. You know, maybe there's no more go-kart racing because on the weekends I'm going to this property, you know, it's gonna be a lifestyle change. 

[00:41:41] Jimmy: Cleaning the drains out at the house 20 miles away, cleaning 

[00:41:44] David: the, yeah.

Yeah. So I'm excited and I, I think it, I do think it will help the business in the, in the long run. I'm just. I'm wondering if we can 

[00:41:55] Jimmy: just accept the terms. It doesn't seem like property is ever a bad investment. For the most part, yeah. Unless a train with chemicals crashes on your backyard. But besides that, it seems like it's always going to be a long term investment.

Sometimes it's a quick flip, but... Anything seems like it would be. 

[00:42:15] Bob: I feel like it might be, has potential to be a hard investment, but not a bad investment. Yeah, right. Yes. You know. Yeah, it just makes things difficult. What, so what about bad investments though? Like, what have you, is there a tool? Is there a, you know, you talked about the online class or the, whatever, the course for painting.

Is there something that you thought would be really beneficial and it just, it just has not paid off? This 

[00:42:38] David: is not a diss on you. This company or this tool at all, but I really thought I was going to use my Shaper Origin a lot more, like a lot more, and I have not, and that was a very expensive machine. Um, And it is a very, it's an amazing machine, but I have not used it very much.

I think 

[00:43:01] Jimmy: with the shaper, and again, it's not, it's no disrespect to the shaper, because people have them and they get so much out of them. Someone like me and Dave, like you, that has a CNC machine and understands, instead of being like, oh, how can I take my CNC machine to the work? We're always trying to figure out how can we get the work under the CNC machine, because that's the least path, the path of least resistance.

And you're like, you know you have the ripple. Cord to take the machine to the work. But you, you'll, you'll literally put a car under that thing before you take the machine over there. Just 'cause you know, the convenience of sitting at the side of the gantry and just hitting start. Mm-Hmm, . So that's been my, my hangup with it.

It's, I know no matter what, I will make sure whatever I need to see, even if I have to like, cut the roof off the car and stick it under the CC machine, , I just, I use that as. It's a comfort thing. Yeah, it's easier for me to use the CNC machine, because that's what I know. But the guys that grow up learning how to use the Shaper, will figure out how to use it in every way, shape, and form, no pun intended.

And they do a fantastic job. There's a guy in Europe who uses the Shaper for everything, and his work is just bananas. I wish I could remember his name, but the Shaper channel promotes him a lot. He makes everything with the shaper. Every joint on every piece of furniture he does. Like, it doesn't even seem logical, but he his workflow makes it work every time.

Sean sent me the guy's name. I won't know it, but Yeah, I think that's it. We just started on a different path. 

[00:44:26] David: The one investment that as a self employed person that always, always pays off, and I think you guys can agree with this, is space. Like, shop space, work space. Yeah. Like, we got it too. We live We have a house that has two garages.

We thought, I have space for days. I've run out of space. Because of all these stupid things that I want to do. And Bob, you've got a big space. And I've been over there. You've filled up the whole thing. And I haven't been to Jimmy's barn. But that is filled. Packed. 

[00:45:01] Jimmy: Yeah. And now I have the barn down the street.

The barn that's attached to the old house. And I put my first thing in it the other day. 

[00:45:09] David: Uh uh. The Robo. A new bandsaw? 

[00:45:12] Jimmy: Oh, there is a bandsaw, it came with a bandsaw, no joke, there was a bandsaw in the basement of the bar and there was an old woodshop and there's an old bandsaw, there's an old craftsman, like maybe a 24 inch bandsaw, it looks like it would work fine, it's just for some reason it's slightly dismantled, but all the parts are there.

And so there's that. That bar in which I'm gonna fill up with stuff. Excited. Looks really excited. That's the 

[00:45:34] Bob: plan. I'm 

[00:45:35] Jimmy: really, really excited to fill it up with stuff. I'm trying to think of 

[00:45:40] Bob: a tool that I've bought and not really taken. Well, the TIG welder. I thought that having a TIG welder would afford me the, like...

The practice, you know, like if it's there, then I'll practice with it. And if it comes to steel, I just, I have not had any reason to even like test it on steel because I can do everything I need, I need personally with a MIG welder and it's faster and it's easier. And I don't have to learn a new skill. I can just do the thing and move on.

The times I've tried to use it for aluminum have been super frustrating and barely workable. And so then I just have this pretty nice welder that just kind of sits there and gets in the way, you know? Have 

[00:46:32] David: either one of you thought it would be worth the 20, 000 to get a laser welder? Have you seen them?

It looks like it works like a glue gun. 

[00:46:40] Jimmy: Have you seen a laser welder? I'm hoping somebody will give me one. Oh my 

[00:46:43] David: goodness. They are bonkers. It works like a glue gun. Or a caulking gun. And it's zip zip. But they're insanely expensive. 

[00:46:54] Bob: Hmm. Well, that would definitely be a bad investment. I don't think I would get that one.

I could say, I could probably say that the Bridgeport and Lathe were a bad investment. Really? Except that, well, because I really haven't used them very much. I have not taken advantage of Having that capability, really. I mean, a little bit, but not, not to the point that I thought I would. And I think one of the problems that I have is just that I assume that if something is there, I'll use it.

Like, I have this endless pool of ideas that I just, I can't quite get to because I don't have a mill or I don't have a metal lathe or I don't have a welder or whatever. And when it comes down to it, it's like, it's nice to have the capacity to do something, but if I don't have an idea to take advantage of it, it still gets unused.

You know what I mean? And so that's... 

[00:47:54] Jimmy: You do need to, you do need to force, I need to force myself to utilize a lot of the machinery I have around. So, A, I don't lose the skill set if there is any left, or the interest level, to remember the viability of it. So there are times where... I forced myself to use a machine, which might not be the right machine for the job, but in my mind, I'm like, it's here, I bought it, I need to remember, like, I don't want to lose, I don't want to lose my, my mojo for the thing completely.

And I'll play with it, and I'll be like, oh, why haven't I played with this more often? I love this machine. Whatever it is. But I do go through that. I have 

[00:48:32] David: this, uh, yeah, the Inkra iBox joint jig. It was... Probably 250 some dollars. It was really expensive and it works really well, but I have to watch a dang video every time I go to use it because it's complicated and so hard to set up.

And so I don't use it. And looking back, you know, at that time, 200 and some dollars was probably. A big investment. Like, oh, this is going to save me a lot of time, and this is, this is going to make doing things so easy. And it just, it just sits on a, sits on a shelf. 

[00:49:10] Bob: But do you think over the years you've used it enough to make it worthwhile?

No, because... 

[00:49:16] David: Um, a few years ago, or two, maybe two years ago, I made a box joint. Uh, how to video where I just made a basically a crosscut sled with a pin in it and I have that. And it's always set up for, um, a quarter inch, quarter inch finger joints. So if I use my data blade and I just use that because it's already set up and I just have to use it.

Yeah. 

[00:49:44] Bob: Not a good. Yeah. Because I got one of those too and I have to relearn it every several years when I use it. As well. But, I've ended up using it enough that I feel like even if I were to drop it in the trash can right now, it would have been worth the money. I wouldn't do that. But, like, you know, I think when I was doing my kitchen, I used it for some stuff.

No, it wasn't the kitchen. I don't know. At some point, I used it a whole bunch. And that was the time that I'm like, okay, even if it was just for this one instance of having it available, it was worthwhile. There's some tools, like I have a plasma cutter, that I never could quite get working. And I've just never actually used it properly.

And it wasn't expensive, but it also just is a thing that now I have that I don't want to throw away because it's basically brand new. I don't know that I could give it to somebody because I don't know if there's something wrong with it, you know what I mean? Um, same kind of thing, I got a, uh, spool gun for a MIG welder so that I could try to do aluminum with the MIG welder.

Didn't work. Don't know why. 

[00:50:47] Jimmy: I just, I just tried mine again for the first time in a while and it works great. I was playing with it. Man, I don't know, I 

[00:50:52] Bob: don't know if... So now I'm stuck with the thing that's basically brand new and I don't know if it's... Uses, uses... I assume I'm the problem, but I argon gas, by the way.

Yeah. That's... So, I have a few things like that and it seems, now that I'm saying it out loud, it sounds like it's mostly metalworking. Hmm. Maybe that says more about me than the tools, but... Um, even out at the farm, like, I, I, uh, I've tried to only buy stuff out there that I had a specific need for around the car, and that has worked out pretty well, because I guess the only, the only caveat to that is I bought the same MIG welder that I had here at the house that I really like.

It's like a Lincoln. 240, I don't know, something. But I bought the same one out there, and then I started doing a bunch of sheet metal, and realized that, like, it's just too powerful. It's too good of a welder to do really thin sheet metal. So, I went and got a welder from Harbor Freight. Sounds like I bought a worse welder, but I actually just bought a cheaper, lower powered welder on purpose.

Still, actually, it wasn't that much cheaper. But, um, it turned out that the, a 110 welder for sheet metal just is a better, it's easier for me to control and, and do really small welds. And so, I guess, you know, as far as the tools out there for the car, that's the only one. The Lincoln welder is just like an unnecessary purchase and that was, you know, that was a bad investment other than just I didn't know quite what I needed, you know, when I got it.

But I'm sure I'll use it eventually. So, anything else? Any other totally different things where you, you know, maybe just spent a bunch of time in something and just turned out not to be worthwhile? Yeah, that Ken 

[00:52:44] David: Griffey rookie card that I bought back in the 90s, it's worth nothing now. Some of y'all know what I'm talking about.

[00:52:51] Bob: How many hundreds of dollars did you spend on that card? 

[00:52:55] David: Probably 100. I don't know what it is. Really? No, I don't remember. Um, Baseball. I have, uh, the funny thing is my, all my baseball cards, I don't even know what I have anymore. They're all at my friend's house. Uh, like. An hour away. He was an 

[00:53:14] Bob: old roommate.

Sounds like they're your friend's 

[00:53:15] David: baseball cards. Well, he's had them for 25 years now, um, but he was an old roommate and he's like, yeah, I still have all your baseball cards. I'm like, yeah, one day I'm going to make the hour trip to go get them. I, um, but, uh, I was big into baseball and football cards as a, as a kid.

And I know they're, they're worth nothing now, thanks to the internet and the availability of getting anything that you want. 

[00:53:44] Bob: My kid, okay, so I was never into Pokemon, just while we're talking about cards real quick. I was never into Pokemon, it was like I was in college or whatever when it came out, so it was not interesting to me.

My kids got into Pokemon a while back, and then they just buy a bunch of these cards and they throw them all around and they trade them and they whatever. And turns out that my kid, one of them has a card that's like 400. It makes no sense to me, cause there's... Thousands and thousands, I mean, I guess baseball cards are the same way, I don't know, I never was into cards, but it blows my mind that there's any reason that a little piece of paper that just happened to not get printed as many times as another piece of paper is worth 400.

And so now, you know, he's like, had me buy a sleeve for it, so that we have it in a sleeve, and now he's like, can you put it in a safe so it doesn't get messed up? And I'm like, yeah, sure, man. So, we have one card that has some sort of value. But, I guess that was a good investment. I don't know. Uh, any other thoughts on this stuff?

Investments? 

[00:54:47] Jimmy: I never really, I don't usually have too much regret. They said if I do and it's... If I can, sometimes, if it's a thing that's hand off able, that's usually how I get rid of the regret is I just give it away. It's like, you can have it. 

[00:55:01] Bob: I mean, that's good, you know? That gives somebody else the chance to make something out of it if it didn't work for you.

[00:55:06] Jimmy: My loss is your gain. 

[00:55:09] Bob: If anybody wants a plasma cutter. Anybody want a house? With a graveyard. No, you should keep the graveyard, just give the house away. Oh yeah, yeah, that's 

[00:55:17] Jimmy: good. Do you have permission to do 

[00:55:19] Bob: whatever you want with the graveyard? No. 

[00:55:23] Jimmy: A couple of people around town said, yeah, as long as they do, they're like, they don't care.

You know, I talked to some of the guys that are kind of loosely associated with the town supervisor people and they're like, you can do whatever you want, no one's going to care. But I mean, I would not alter it in any way other than just to make it better. Can we have a Halloween party at your place? We could.

Yeah, that's a great idea. I'm not going to rearrange the gravestones. If anything, I'm just going to square them up. Write them, and that's it. That would be the only thing I do. I 

[00:55:52] Bob: wouldn't have them moving around. Okay, so I have an idea for you. I'm going to tell you in the after show. I'm going to tell you in the after show.

I have an idea for, yeah. It's really good. And by really, I mean not very. But, I'm going to tell you about it in a little bit. Alright, well, I want to thank our Patreon supporters for investing in our show. Hopefully the show is not a bad investment for those people. That one might have been forced, but it did it anyway.

Big thanks to everybody that helps us out over there. Uh, we are really grateful for all the support. You know, and everybody gets the after show no matter the level. That they've supported. We had some, uh, changes this last week. Some people dropped down to lower levels and some people came up to higher levels.

Uh, specifically, the new Janky Workshop is now on our top group. Oh, cool. Thank you, buddy. Yeah. Um, so big thanks to, to him and everybody else. Uh, that top group of supporters. The people that go above and beyond are Crabtree Creative, The Webb Ranch Woodworks, Gretchen Hofer, Michael Menegen, Warren Works, Stu Morrison, Scott Oram, Odin Leather Goods, Rich at Low End Designs.

Uh, the new Janky Workshop, Chad's Custom Creations, Chad from ManCraftingWorksBySolo, Albers Woodworks, and Cory Ward. But also people like Andy Woodruff. So there's a lot of people that help us. And we're grateful for all of them. Uh, if you guys want to get the app to show you want to hear my idea for Jimmy's graveyard, go to patreon.

com slash making it and help us out. That's good. We would appreciate it. All right, you guys have anything to 

[00:57:20] Jimmy: recommend? I was going to mention Zoe, Zoe Wilson, stone carving. And I put her Instagram in the chat. She makes these beautiful geometric patterns. And like I said, the stone carving is one skill set that is obviously top notch, but her ability to create beautifully graphic geometric patterns and carve intricately through them, it's unbelievable.

And I'm sure she's sick and tired of people asking her, is that a CNC carving? Because that's what they all look like. It's like wood, you know how like when people do chip carving in wood, it's usually those sort of folk art traditional patterns? She's taken that times ten and does it in stone. Cool.

[00:58:02] Bob: Check it out. 

[00:58:04] David: Mine is a Kevin Smith talk. I will say I like clerks. I'm a fan of clerks. Kevin Smith wrote clerks, but I'm not one of those annoying clerk fanboys. I'm not quoting and doing impressions all the time, uh, sorry to all the clerk fanboys out there, but um, Kevin Smith, he, this is on the People Magazine, uh, YouTube channel, he does a, it's a talk on mental health, and it is, it's 34 minutes of just nothing but really, really good stuff, he's telling some very vulnerable life stories, it's just, Such a good talk and it was worth like every every second that I invested into watching this video.

It was so good. 

[00:58:53] Bob: Wow, cool Okay Cool, cool Mine is a new video by my buddy Jeremy Fielding. He has a channel where he makes stuff and like talks about engineering and robotics and like he's built a big robotic arm from scratch and stuff like that. But he has a second channel that's all about fatherhood and it's called Fatherhood Engineered and he...

Just talks life lesson stuff. He's a father of four and, um, he, he's just a good dude and I really enjoy hanging out with him. I've seen him a lot in the last couple of weeks and, um, he just put out a new video today so I thought I'd throw it out there. But it's, it's like good stuff. He's a good guy. He's got great insight onto things, a lot of life experience and stuff, so.

Yeah, he's got good stuff. 

[00:59:44] Jimmy: He always has good stuff. 

[00:59:45] Bob: Yep. Cool. Well, I'm going to go to a trade show this week. I'll let you know how it goes next week. And, uh, once you guys got anything else, we'll wrap it up. Thank you, thank 

[00:59:59] Jimmy: you. Thank 

[01:00:01] Bob: you. Cool. Thanks for listening, everybody. Thank you, everybody. We'll see you next time.

Love you.
