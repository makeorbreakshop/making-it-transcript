410 - Making It
===

[00:00:00] Bob: David, um, I got accosted by several people in Arkansas because you weren't there. I 

[00:00:12] Jimmy: told them you went to get a coffee. He's like, mm hmm, I don't care. 

[00:00:17] Bob: I had several people that wanted, that were really disappointed that you weren't around. They said to tell you hello and wanted to see you. Well, hello. Yes.

[00:00:26] Bob: There you go. That's pretty much the response that I told them they would get. Yeah, um, I was, I was in Arkansas, and it was cool. Um, 

[00:00:35] David: I had other obligations, and, uh, I just couldn't go. Sorry. Yeah. 

[00:00:42] Jimmy: You know, it was a nice event that we, we threw me, Howard and Jordan threw an event at the factory that we were working in there.

[00:00:48] Jimmy: And it was, Bob, it was great that you came, so thank you so much. And, uh, but it wasn't like the big hoopla, it wasn't like make a camp, or it wasn't like making it 100, it wasn't that type of event. It was probably, I don't know, Bob, what do you say, about 40 people showed up? Yeah, 40, 50, something like that.

[00:01:04] Jimmy: Yeah, and some great fans came from far away, and some fans that, like, came down the block, like, I heard you talk, I live right here. So it was a nice mix of people from far away and close, and it was, it was a nice event that, for me personally, it was nice to meet some locals, because I'll be going back there a little bit more often.

[00:01:22] Jimmy: And, uh, it was a nice event. So, for those that don't know, Howard, Jordan, and myself acquired a factory in Arkansas. It was through some rambling. It was like, uh, it was a real winding road, how we ended up here. But it all started with the Walmart deal two years ago, when I got called by Walmart. One thing led to another, and now...

[00:01:42] Jimmy: We couldn't manufacture in America, so that led to a lot of investigation to try and make things in America, and now we have a factory made in Arkansas. And we ended up there because we were dealing with a partner that was involved with Walmart, which is in Bentonville, and so that's why we're all in Arkansas now.

[00:01:56] Jimmy: And it's uh, it's, it's off to a good running start because Jordan's business is, is the lead, is the lead client with the most, right now with the most turnover of product. Jordan has a company. On Etsy called Two Avocados and he has a healthy business making and selling signs and that's the majority of what we're making right now.

[00:02:18] Jimmy: But we're taking in a lot of other Etsy shops and like I said in my live stream a way back, if you're at capacity in your garage making stuff that's selling and you're sick of it and you're sick of packing boxes and running the CNC with your feet and typing labels with your hands, that's why we're there to alleviate that if that's something you wanted to get involved in and it's working out so far.

[00:02:43] Bob: So the reason I was out there was I was, I mean, I was invited to come out there, but um, you know, I wanted to see the factory and, and actually meet the other two, um, and just kind of see how it was going, because, you know, we've got some ideas, things we'd like to make that I don't really have the capacity to make.

[00:03:01] Bob: And so part of it was just exploration for me and get to hang out with everybody. It's great to see Jimmy again. Um, but I will say that that place is. Incredibly impressive. I was. It's, 

[00:03:12] Jimmy: isn't it? I was, I haven't seen impress. I was really impressed. I saw pictures of it all year, but I never was there. 

[00:03:18] Bob: It's, it's gigantic for one.

[00:03:20] Bob: It was, it used to be a Walmart store or a 

[00:03:23] Jimmy: Yeah, it was a Walmart many, many, many years ago. Some of the old timers that were locals said this was a Walmart. Then it was a home center most people remember for the home center. Gotcha. It was, it was like a, it was like a off branded Home Depot. Yeah. And the sign is still in the back when you go for the back entrance.

[00:03:39] Bob: Well, it's, it's huge. It's broken into three or four big giant rooms and they're barely taking advantage of the space. Like there's just so much space. Um, and that was cool to see, but you know, big buildings are, you know, whatever. Uh, it was actually expensive, I'm sure. Yeah. Um, I can't imagine the cost to cool that place because it was comfortable in there, but good grief.

[00:04:03] Jimmy: And we walked around on the roof with the mate, one of the maintenance guys who wanted to show us. I don't know if you met Eric. Eric's kind of the main guy in charge of the whole building. Eric showed, and also the operation. Eric showed us around and he was pointing out several, there's like 15 air conditioners on that roof.

[00:04:17] Jimmy: He pointed out like five of them that don't work. So we're talking about what to do with them. You know, it's, I'm just, honestly, I mean, it's impressive that I'm a partner in it, but. I feel like I'm just tagging along. I'm like, I'm in the passenger seat, but Howard and Jordan keep saying, no, no, no, you're a big part of this.

[00:04:34] Jimmy: I'm like, I keep calling it their business. It's like, no, this is our business. So I appreciate that from those guys. But 

[00:04:39] Bob: it was really impressive, not only the facility, but just like the way that they have it set up and the machines and the people that they had working were great and, you know, working hard and, um, the flow and the, the kind of, I don't know.

[00:04:54] Bob: The way that the whole thing was running was really impressive to me and gave me a lot of, uh, Yeah, they've been, 

[00:04:59] Jimmy: they've been at it for a year. I haven't really... I haven't talked about it earlier, only because we were still working out the kinks with the partners and everything, and it could have gone one way or another.

[00:05:09] Jimmy: And we worked all the kinks out now, and everything is smoothed out. Which is why now, finally, I'm talking about it. We've been doing it for over a year. And I've been kind of mentioning it a little bit in the past. About a year ago, I went to Arkansas. That's when we were first looking for a location with the other partner.

[00:05:22] Jimmy: And we settled on a few places, but when I left, it was about a month later, Jordan called me and told me they found this place in Russellville, which is the place we visited, which I hadn't been to until... The other day. Yeah. So yeah, it's been going on in the background and, and now here we are. Yeah. 

[00:05:38] Bob: It was very, very cool.

[00:05:40] Bob: Uh, I was impressed and, and just to see, like, to hear a lot of the conversations with other people who are wanting to make things there and what that's gonna bring to the facility and to their capabilities, you know? Yeah. 

[00:05:54] Jimmy: We moving into metal now, we just signed a Yeah. Partnership. We're going to go into a partnership with a metal fabricator.

[00:05:59] Jimmy: I'll talk more about it when everything's up and running. But it's somebody that a lot of people know. So, he's going to be making stuff in our factory. This is 

[00:06:07] David: very cool. 

[00:06:08] Bob: Yeah. And it was a good time. Like, everybody that I met, both, you know, Jordan and Howard, but also just all the people that showed up.

[00:06:16] Bob: All the people that we work hmm.

[00:06:20] Bob: It was really cool. It was very, very comfortable to be there. And other than the eight hour drive, I drove. Um, but I will say this was kind of weird. I didn't expect this. So I've not rented many cars in my life, maybe just a couple of times. And we're, you know, I'm still waiting on a cruiser. It wouldn't make that trip anyway.

[00:06:38] Bob: So. I was like, Oh, I'll rent a car and it's only me, so I can get some small, you know, and so I just rented a car, didn't really pay attention to what it was. And then I got this like, I don't know, Camry, something like a 2020 Cam, uh, Camry with like the racing package, these tiny little wheels and like sport mode and a this and a that.

[00:07:01] Bob: And I don't know what all it was. But that was a very, very fast car. And so it was actually kind of fun to have an eight hour drive through Arkansas where the speed limit is 75 on the highway. So that was kind of cool. But, uh, you know, so the first six hours or so was pretty boring, the last two hours kind of fun because you can open up this car that I'm not used to a little bit and it's not mine.

[00:07:24] Bob: And, you know, it was a lot of driving in a short amount of time, but it was a good trip. So. Thanks for having me out. 

[00:07:32] Jimmy: Of course, no speeding 

[00:07:33] Bob: tickets? No speeding tickets, no. No, I was, I was reasonable, yeah. I didn't go too crazy. But, I'm bringing all that up to say, David, people were asking about you and were, you know, genuinely looking forward to seeing you and stuff, so a lot of people said to tell you hi.

[00:07:48] David: Well, thank you, and hello, and I'm sorry I missed all you. 

[00:07:54] Bob: Well, hopefully we'll do it again sometime. What have you guys been up to? We were traveling, I guess this was last week. Yeah. End of last week. Mm. Beginning of last week. I don't 

[00:08:02] Jimmy: know what that was. Yeah. Well, what I've, I've been up to. I, I was traveling, but I don't, I didn't put in any videos, but I've been working.

[00:08:08] Jimmy: Some of you guys might've seen it. I work with the millennial stone cleaner, uh, Wade Fowler. Wade Fowler. He's got a big, I'm gonna recommend him this week. He's got a big internet presence and he cleans. Tombstones and grave walkers. That's his, that's his day in, day out. He has a regular job, but this is something he's always been passionate about.

[00:08:28] Jimmy: And at the recommendation of some friends, I said, you should start filming that. And when he did, all of a sudden, he has a whole community. And he was going to bring a friend that his friend canceled at the last minute. But he was very happy and I was very, I was obviously very happy that he came. I learned a tremendous amount from him.

[00:08:45] Jimmy: We dug up and repositioned like five or seven stones, and the one, the biggest one, was a 10 foot tall obelisk on, was a big base, a middle base that has the inscription on it, and an obelisk, so it's actually four parts, and each part weighs a thousand pounds, and we set up a little tripod, and we picked it up, and moved it, and cleaned it, and dug out the foundation, I was excited because I was hoping to find a I find a, uh, not a body, because it's called blasphemy, but I see like the tip of a casket.

[00:09:14] Jimmy: We dug deep, but I was hoping to find at least some sort of remnant of somebody might have put something there that marked the date, like a time capsule or something. Nothing. I didn't find the old newspaper in there or anything. This is all back...

[00:09:28] Jimmy: When we put it all back, I threw one of the director razor blades in there underneath the 5, 000 pounds of stone we put back so that when they open it up in 100 years from now or whenever, we'll see it. But I'm glad we did that because, and I kept saying to him, I'm glad you picked this stone because it was so much work.

[00:09:45] Jimmy: He actually, we started working the day I got back. So I got back on Wednesday evening. Thursday morning, we used to work all day Thursday, we worked all day Friday, and then Saturday he had to go do something, and then he says I'll be back Sunday. Because he's driving all around the Northeast, he's from Iowa, but he was driving all around the Northeast visiting friends and doing stone work.

[00:10:03] Jimmy: He went to a couple cemeteries in the short time he was with me, and it was a lot of work, like digging deep and... And he kept saying to me, he's going to laugh when he hears this, he kept saying to me, he's like, cause I'm Gen X and he's Millennium. And he kept saying, he goes, I'm, I'm embarrassed that you work so hard and I can't keep up with you.

[00:10:23] Jimmy: He kept having to like, stop. He kept having to like, I'm going to just take a break. And I was just like, all right, you take a break. And he like never stopped once. And once we lifted that last of the four giant stones, and then we were like, okay, let's just dig the hole for the gravel and for the foundation.

[00:10:38] Jimmy: I chipped my shovel and it just slid across all this dirt and underneath it was. Another thousand pound rock, but it was a five inch, it was probably 500 pounds. It was about five inches thick at its thickest, but it was 48 inches square. Like hand chiseled from like a, it was very rough chiseled from a quarry.

[00:10:59] Jimmy: And that was the foundation underneath this stone. And we didn't have the way with all the movement. And he's like, you know what, let's just break it up. Cause when it's, we're not going to use it again. So we broke out some sledgehammers and smashed it up and moved it all. And they're like, okay. And then we started, and then there was hundreds of other rocks underneath that.

[00:11:18] Jimmy: So they dug a deep foundation and just stacked all these slate stones, these blue stones, like you would see a wall made out of, and then put this giant stone on top of it. So it took us another couple of hours to prepare the whole, we just kept pulling out these rocks and each rock weighed. 20, 30 pounds underneath the big one we broke up.

[00:11:36] Bob: So why pull those out? Why not just use that base as the... 

[00:11:40] Jimmy: Because they were all just mishap shaped on top of one another if there was any order to them it was all moved around now from the frost and the heave. And so you had stones with like this much dirt between them like about a half inch or an inch of dirt between them, where they might have been properly stacked, the earth moving underneath them for 150 years has just made them just a mushy thing.

[00:11:59] Jimmy: And it was really.... Tilted. So it was almost about to fall over. Another winter, I think, and with frost and heave that the obelisk would have fallen over and the obelisk is, is on top of the base is about seven feet tall. This 

[00:12:11] David: is the one you were talking about a few weeks ago saying you're worried it was going to fall over.

[00:12:15] Jimmy: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Cause that's why I say I'm saying all this. Just to talk about how much work it was and the fact that I was like, well, I go, I would like to fix this. I go, but that's a lot of work. Let's do all these smaller ones and we can do that another time. And I was just going to put a two by four under it.

[00:12:30] Jimmy: So it didn't fall over. But when I, when we started on. There's the Friday morning. He's like, he was there a minute before me and he's like, I think we should do this one. I was like, okay, cool. But when we got into it, I just kept saying, I'm glad you picked this one and not me. Yeah, the amount of work we put.

[00:12:44] Jimmy: Because the fact that he picked it, I knew he wasn't gonna stop until it was done. Right. Yeah. If I picked it, he'd be like, all right, you're on your own. You know what you're doing now. No, but we had to dig out. We dug it all that out and put about 40, we had these half These three gallon buckets, we put about 53 gallon buckets of gravel.

[00:13:04] Jimmy: This is gravel across the street at the house for the foundation wall rebuild. So I drive my truck over and fill up these six buckets and then drive back and then fill up these six buckets and then dump them in the hole and it must have been 40 or 50 buckets and they had to be filled with a shovel on a 90 degree day, each one of those.

[00:13:19] Jimmy: So it was really physically taxing. But you know, they always say when you, when you're at your limit, you always think you're at your limit. There's always more. And it was one of those days where I was at my limit like five times. I know he was because he kept talking about it, but I'm at my limit and I'm like, there's always a little more.

[00:13:34] Jimmy: It's open. 

[00:13:38] Bob: So were there no name plates on that at all? There's no chisel in name or dates or 

[00:13:43] Jimmy: anything? Not, not by the, not by the, the grave maker. But there's names from the people of, of course. And there is Find a grave.com if anybody's at all cur, you can go to find a grave.com and look up the Allen Teeter Road Cemetery.

[00:13:56] Jimmy: You do some research on it. Alan Teter Road Cemetery. It's also called the Burg Family Farm Cemetery. That's that's the other name for it. 'cause the family that owned the house for so many years. For the majority, it's called the Burg family, and so they call it the Ravens Family Farm Cemetery on a Teeter Road.

[00:14:15] Jimmy: That's a cool name. I joined find a grave.com, and I've been adding pictures of the graves, some of the graves, the la, all the pictures on the, now from the eighties, somebody had went on. I guess when the internet finally came out, somebody went through the pictures that they had. Somebody had documented them in photography and went on and put them up in digital prints, put them up digitally.

[00:14:36] Jimmy: And now I'm going through and just the various pictures that I have of the various graves. I'm looking and adding to photo albums that are already there, what they look like now 40 years later. And adding pictures that aren't. At all. So 50 percent of the graves on there. There's about 150 graves and 50 percent of them are photographed on that website.

[00:14:54] Jimmy: The other 50 percent I'm going to try and add to as time goes on. So I'll log in every once in a while and add a few pictures. Cool. So there you go. That's fun. It's fun researching. And one of the graves that we dug up... I went and looked, I found it in this cemetery online, on this findagrave. com, there was a picture of the one grave we repositioned correctly.

[00:15:16] Jimmy: Right next to it was the one that was broken in the grass, so we knew where it was supposed to be. So we dug around that, and I found the two sections below what was exposed. So there was two sections below. This is somebody who died in 1800 and his grave I have here on the welding table. I'm gonna do a, it's in six pieces now.

[00:15:38] Jimmy: This gravestone is broken into six pieces. I'm gonna piece it back together with stainless steel, a framework on the back. So the front of it will look normal, you just see two quarter inch pieces of stainless steel on either side. I'm gonna kind of do a museum, a museum Holds to keep it's cool. Is it as if it was like there was at a stone and then once that's all secured I'm gonna put it back in its place.

[00:16:01] Jimmy: I he said don't don't do epoxy because it never works You can't really glue stone together for an extremely period of time, especially in it. It also doesn't look good It gives you this like muddy, you see a lot of the stones in the cemetery that are broken in half or try to be glued and now weather has deteriorated the joint and they're upside down in two pieces and then there's glue on half sides of the joint, you know, so it just makes it messy.

[00:16:24] Jimmy: So I'm going to piece it together as like a jigsaw puzzle in space and I'll strategically pin it with small pins to keep it from falling out of the frame. Hmm, that's really cool. That's my idea. We'll see. Yeah. So that'll be in the video when, when I post the video of us doing the restorations. And he'll come back in the spring.

[00:16:41] Jimmy: He wants to come back. There's lots. He said it was funny. He said he, this is one of the sites he worked on that was the most peaceful because it's off the main road and only people that live in that area pass by and they're all like, oh, they're fixing the graves. They don't even care to stop and ask.

[00:16:56] Jimmy: They just drive it like, hi. Yeah. One guy stopped and he says, are you taking or adding? I go, what? Are you taking away or are you adding? I said, we're fixing. He went, okay. And we just drove. I expected, like, the town supervisor or somebody to come and give us a pain in the back. But nobody did. And we're only doing good, so we're not worried at all.

[00:17:17] Jimmy: But it was fun. I learned a lot from him. He really, we walked through some of the cemeteries in the neighborhood and he pointed out lots of historical facts about, about graveyards that I never knew. How did he get 

[00:17:29] David: into 

[00:17:29] Jimmy: such work? He said he's always been into it. He said it's just a something. I think he said his grandfather got him into it.

[00:17:35] Jimmy: Because they were taking care of some family graves when he was little. Hmm. And it's just something. Hmm. You know how when you go, and this is one thing I learned from him, I didn't know, you know when you go into some cemeteries, there's like a, look, what seems like a mausoleum, might be like 20 by 20, doesn't have a family name on it, so you wonder really what it is.

[00:17:53] Jimmy: Those are usually called the receiving vaults, and that's where they put the bodies, if it was wintertime, because they couldn't dig a hole, because this was before hydraulics and backhoes, so they would wait till the springtime, and then. Wow. Dig the hole and then bury the people dead. So they'd have the ceremony around the, if there was a tombstone and there'd be no body, the body would be in the receiving vault for the winter.

[00:18:19] Bob: Seems like they would just like go ahead in the fall, dig a couple extra holes just to have them around, you know? 

[00:18:27] Jimmy: They would have to guess who was dying, I guess. it 

[00:18:30] Bob: would, it would matter. 

[00:18:32] Jimmy: They'd need to know who was dying and where. They'd have to look in their crystal ball. So there's, there's lots of little facts like that.

[00:18:41] Jimmy: There was what I never knew. There was one gravestone that we looked at that it wasn't in the cemetery. It was in the nearby town cemetery. It was made out of zinc and it was made in the early 1800s. I was unbelievably in perfect condition. It looked like it was made last week. And he said, he goes, Oh yeah, this is zinc.

[00:19:00] Jimmy: And there was, uh, there was some sort of like marketing race. Zinc graves are, they look like cast zinc. And then every letter, everything on them is absolutely perfect. Every edge is still extremely sharp, all the details. But it's pieced together with nuts and bolts from inside. And he said there was like a little bit of a marketing war.

[00:19:21] Jimmy: The stone guys won. They said, you really want a zinc tombstone? They're never gonna last. They lost that marketing war. And now the zinc tombstone is in absolutely perfect condition 170 years later. And all the other stone ones are all acid washed and deteriorated, you can at least read the font on them.

[00:19:40] Jimmy: Interesting.

[00:19:44] Bob: Crazy. Well, how many graves did you fix and clean up, David? Uh, zero. I'm 

[00:19:50] David: way behind on my grave cleanup. Way behind. That's why I couldn't make it out to Arkansas.

[00:19:59] David: So I, I finished up a project that I started two years ago. A couple years ago, a high end

[00:20:10] David: DIY kit. And they've been in our living room. We've been using them for two years, but they're just like raw plywood. So it was, it was time to, to finish them up and make them look pretty. So that's what we were working on the last few weeks. And I made the stands that we were talking about. I didn't do the pour epoxy because it wouldn't, there was no way to pour the epoxy in, but I'm really happy with the way they.

[00:20:35] David: Came out about 95 percent happy. I'm actually remaking the grills and, uh, they look really good in our living room. So the next up, next thing I got to do for the living room is make the stereo stand because we have one of those Ikea ones there and I need a place to hold all our records and cassettes and I want to have like an outplaying area.

[00:20:56] Jimmy: And what did you end up doing with that fin shape in the, in the bottom stand? I saw it in the pictures. 

[00:21:01] David: Um, so I, I basically, I, uh, so it's, it's like an airplane wing, but yeah, but horizontal and, um, or vertical and the skeleton of it, it wraps around some steel poles. So there is a top sheet of metal, bottom sheet of metal with two bars running in between there.

[00:21:26] David: And then I, um, cut some insulation foam on the CNC to give it that airplane shape and then wrap veneer around that. And that worked out. Oh, really, really good. Yeah. 

[00:21:37] Jimmy: Nice. Cool. It looked good. I saw the, you did like a little photo montage of it somewhere. I must have seen on Twitter maybe. Yeah. The, the 

[00:21:44] David: interesting thing about it is I made it so the fat part of the airplane wing was supposed to be in the front, but when I'm all done, it just looked like two circular columns.

[00:21:57] David: So if I flipped the stands around backwards, it, it went from skinny to fat. And it looks so much better. So after I was all done, I decided, Oh, I'm going to flip them around. And the funny thing is the, the base is like solid two inch walnut. And I used the, the good side of the walnut for what I thought was going to be the front.

[00:22:17] David: And then the cracks where you could see some little checks in the walnut or in the back, but now they're in the front. Cause I flipped the whole thing around, but it's so dark that you can't even tell when you, when you put oil on end grain of walnut. It just looks black and they look, they look fantastic.

[00:22:33] David: And I could see myself using that, that foam insulation. Technique wrapped with veneer again in the future.

[00:22:43] Bob: Interesting. 

[00:22:44] David: That's cool. Yeah. And then, we, Yesterday we started filming another video. I got this, I should have brought it in with me. It's a router bit. And it is, it's got like a helical head with the carbide cutters all the way around it. It's, um, the cutting capacity on it is two and a half inches tall.

[00:23:05] David: Oh my goodness. It is scary. It's, it's probably I don't know, an inch and a half? Uh, Girth, like it's so... Somebody sent it to me, a local guitar maker sent it to me. He's like, have you seen this bit? And I was like, whoa, that's insane. I'm scared. I'm just looking at it. I was scared of the photo. So I bought it.

[00:23:27] David: It was like 120 bucks. And I've been sitting on it for a while because I haven't figured out how to use it. 

[00:23:32] Bob: That sounds uncomfortable.

[00:23:45] David: So, uh, we, we finally made some, um, router template type things. I won't give it all away. And we used a bit. And when you put it in the router and you turn it on, it sounds different. Those, all those little carbide, yeah, like it takes a while to get up to speed because it's so heavy. And then it just creates this like vortex of air around it.

[00:24:09] David: And it is. And on the, on the website, they show it being used in a router table as well as a handheld router. I will never put that thing in a handheld router. Like, there will be death and destruction everywhere. 

[00:24:23] Bob: So what's its, what's the intended purpose for a bit like that? Um, 

[00:24:27] David: so it's got a bearing on the top and the bottom.

[00:24:29] David: So I, I think it's used mostly for like patterns and 

[00:24:33] Bob: templates. Oh, for like a guitar body. 

[00:24:36] David: Like a guitar body, yeah, and it can go up to just a little over two and a half inches thick. And because it has the carbide teeth, it gets dull, you just turn the carbide teeth, you know, a quarter turn. And it's really cool, and it leaves a super clean cut, uh, even on end grain, and it works great.

[00:24:54] David: I just don't see myself using a lot because it's just 

[00:24:58] Bob: so scary. Yeah. Well, I mean, you could just start adding like a wavy edge 2x4 to every project you do. And just make a pattern and just, you know, like add a, add a detail to the side of a 

[00:25:10] David: 2x4. Yeah. It's um, it's a pretty impressive. Pretty impressive bit.

[00:25:19] Bob: Are you going to make any guitars with it? 

Um, 

[00:25:23] David: no, I don't see, I don't think so. Um, any guitar that I make, well, I, I always say one thing and then change my mind later, but any guitar that I see myself making in the near future, I will probably do on the CNC, because it'll probably be just for me, and it'll probably be a revision of the one that I previously made.

[00:25:46] David: I've got my Fusion 360 file all, I, I, I, I toy with the file every couple months and it's, it's all perfect. So yeah, I, I, I see myself as, Only using the CNC from now on for the guitar. Gotcha. And, as you know, guitar videos don't do well anymore, so there will probably be no video. 

[00:26:08] Bob: Yeah. Yeah, that is definitely not something that works.

[00:26:13] Bob: Good for me, anyway. Yeah, 

[00:26:15] David: you gotta find the twist in it, you know? Like, I made a guitar out of popsicle sticks, which probably would do well. I'd turn the guitar into lathes.

[00:26:27] Bob: That's pretty cool. Um, well, let's see. What have I been doing? I've been doing a bunch of stuff. Uh, we started a video last week and

[00:26:47] Bob: I'm not even going to talk about it because I think we're probably going to abandon it. It just didn't have the oomph that it should have had. Make it a 

[00:26:55] Jimmy: reel. Yeah,

[00:26:58] Bob: maybe. I don't know. We'll see. You sound like you're over it. reel has an 

[00:27:02] Jimmy: oomph or not. 

[00:27:04] Bob: It just kind of like... I don't know. It just didn't have, didn't have the thing. So, no big deal. I've got another idea that I can jump to real quick and hopefully knock off this week. Was 

[00:27:16] Jimmy: it that napkin holder that we've been talking about?

[00:27:18] Jimmy: Is 

[00:27:19] Bob: that why you didn't go? No. No, it wasn't a napkin holder. Maybe I should do that.

[00:27:25] Bob: Oh! So... While Jimmy and I were hanging out, I don't know why I thought of this. I do know why I thought of this but Jimmy and I were hanging out and it dawned on me that he was making a joke about making an R2D2 thing a couple of years ago or something on the show and he wouldn't tell me what it was and I was like, Come on, enough time has passed.

[00:27:46] Bob: Tell me what the thing was. And now I can't even remember what it was. 

[00:27:51] Jimmy: I want to do it. It's, I could tell it here because the video could still be successful whether people know the joke or not. It would be me going through like scrap steel and making an R2D2. Out of scrap steel, so the video would be like boom, boom, boom, like plasma cut, scrap steel, grabbing bins, nuts, bolts, all welded together.

[00:28:10] Jimmy: Then I'd have this rusty R2D2 about the size of a trash bin, and then when all was said and done, I would just step on his foot, and his whole head would open up, and I would just throw garbage in it, and it would come out. Yes! 

[00:28:22] David: Yes, yes, yes. That's 

[00:28:24] Jimmy: great. That was, that was the... Now I remember. That was like five years ago when we thought old timers will remember that joke.

[00:28:31] Jimmy: I said I had a perfect idea. I'll make it this week and I have the course now. Yeah, that week, yeah. 

[00:28:34] Bob: It's still 

[00:28:35] Jimmy: on my list to do. 

[00:28:37] Bob: As it should be. Yeah. Yeah, that's a pretty good idea. So yeah, 

[00:28:42] Jimmy: you said you, you, we were having lunch or something. You're like, remember that RTDT you were going to make? What was it?

[00:28:46] Jimmy: Because you were talking about having yours at the fair, at the... 

[00:28:49] Bob: Education. Oh, that's right. Yeah. Yeah, that's what it's, yeah. Well, um, anyway, since I got back, it was a really good trip out to Arkansas. Um, and then when I got back it was just, we were trying to shoot this video in a couple of days. I just don't think it has the, the thing it needs.

[00:29:03] Bob: So, probably gonna switch gears. Um, but I guess like we kind of had a topic today. That is, I don't know, maybe I caused the topic, I'm not sure. There's a bunch of change going on with me and with I Like To Make Stuff. People probably saw on social media that Josh got a new job, which is very exciting. Um, he's now working at First Build.

[00:29:30] Bob: He's a friend of all of ours, which is cool. Yeah, yeah. They put on the, um, Louisville Maker Faire. And he's now doing, like, community engagement and social media and marketing and working with the design teams and like all, it's like a perfect fit for Josh's skill set. 

[00:29:46] David: Congrats to Josh. 

[00:29:48] Bob: That's amazing. Yes, absolutely.

[00:29:50] Bob: It is a very cool thing. I talked to him, uh, yesterday. He had his first day yesterday. So I talked to him and he said it was... He said, this is gonna be fun, was what he ended the description of the day with, so. It's a 

[00:30:00] Jimmy: great place, and the team there is amazing, you guys are welcome. 

[00:30:05] Bob: Uh, and we're hoping to like, do some stuff with First Build 2.

[00:30:09] Bob: Um, you know, he's, he's in charge of like, the community. And like trying to build community around what they do, which is what he did for us, you know, so it's a really fantastic thing. He's doing that. Um, Megan moved on to another job a few weeks ago. I talked to her a couple days ago. She's doing great.

[00:30:29] Bob: She's enjoying the new thing, doing marketing and social media stuff. Anthony's moving on to a new job next week, um, that he's excited about. Uh, they're all moves up for my friends, which is good. And I'm very excited for that reason, uh, for them, for that reason. You know, it's, all of that is happening because of a lot of stuff is just changing with, I like to make stuff, changing with me personally.

[00:30:55] Bob: Just the last couple of years have not been. A lot of fun for me. So, uh, trying to refocus and re prioritize and, and stuff like that. And most of that is none of anybody else's business, so I'm not really going to go into it. But, um, it's a big, it was a big change and a big, uh... Several big decisions that affected a lot of people, a lot of people that I care about a lot, you know, um, and so I, that kind of general topic kind of launched us talking about, before we started recording, about just big decisions and about change and stuff.

[00:31:39] Bob: And, and I know we've all had different, you know, parts of our careers. different careers and different parts of those careers where there have been big upheavals or big steps back or Steps forward or whatever. So I thought it would be interesting just to talk about Some of those things that we've all been through because I think everybody gets to that at some point Even if things are going super well, sometimes you just have to you know You have to have a change for things to go better, or for things to go right, or whatever.

[00:32:07] Bob: So, kind of throw it out there. I don't know, what do you guys have 

[00:32:10] Jimmy: on that? Well, I've been talking about it with a friend of mine. I told you in the beginning, before we started recording, a friend of mine is having some business troubles and can't seem to... Get it together and, and I suggested to this person what I've been through personally, which is you got to take a step back to go forward.

[00:32:27] Jimmy: Sometimes you got to look at your scene and you realize you have all these various things that you're used to because you've gotten to this level. And like me, I look around when I'm like, you guys have seen me, I'm in my shop today. I look around all this and I always have that backup plan in my mind because I've been there.

[00:32:44] Jimmy: What has to happen if the Titanic hits an iceberg? What has to happen? What do I need to do to downsize to be able to go to my core and survive that and then build back again? Then, cause I've been there, and I was suggesting to my friend that they sell some of their machines, or rent some of their space, share the space, but it's tough.

[00:33:07] Jimmy: I mean, I can imagine now, if I'm all alone in this place, and if I had to bring in somebody to help me pay the bills, I'd have to make compromises, but at the same time, you're taking a step back to take a step forward, and that's the one thing you always have to remember in business, is when you're up against it, and you're not getting what you need, you have to make some changes, and it's all in the name of going forward, but you've got to step back, and the other thing too, is a lot of people don't realize, is like, we, we climb this ladder, and if you get to the 12th rung of the ladder, And you got to go down to the 10th rung of the ladder.

[00:33:40] Jimmy: It's not, you're not going back to zero again. I mean, sometimes maybe you have to, and then you build back again. But if you build up, up, up, and then you got to do a couple of steps back and then go up again, you're not, you're not giving it all. You know, we've all created. Certain levels to our career and certain things we're used to and we just got to make compromises.

[00:34:04] Jimmy: And, you know, God forbid if there's a catastrophy you got to go back to zero. That's why we have insurance and friends and family. We deal with it there but just smaller minor decisions in business we just, you just got to confront it. And it was something I said recently where you... Well when I was talking about it in the house.

[00:34:22] Jimmy: When I'm looking through the house, when I'm working in the house. It's a similar gut punch when you're looking around the house and you're like, okay, this whole entire section has to be removed and rebuilt. Whereas I'm making plans to refinish it and then I open up the wall and I'm like, oh, this is never going to work.

[00:34:38] Jimmy: And you just take a step back to take a step forward. So, once you take the gut punch and you think it through a little bit, you're like, Okay, alright, it'll be better if I rip down all these walls and they'll be straighter, cleaner, I'll be able to put plumbing in more easily, I'll be up to code for less than another hundred years.

[00:34:54] Jimmy: If I try to use these, these won't last. So that idea of first taking that initial hit and thinking, Oh, this is going to be horrible. I remember my own personal situation when my landlord called me and said we want our workshop back in the basement. I remember feeling the panic in that phone call. And she's like, but I'll give you six months to move out.

[00:35:16] Jimmy: And then I stepped back and I was like, this is going to be tough. It's going to cost me everything I have in the bank to move and to find a new place. And that was when I thought I was going to buy that, that old gas station. Thankfully, that didn't work out. And I ended up getting the bigger, more commercial space off the beaten path for a fraction of the price.

[00:35:35] Jimmy: And that worked out great, I still have it. So, just the idea of the gut punch and then assessing and then moving forward and making the right decisions for everybody. You gotta do it. Everybody will experience it at one point. Yeah, I 

[00:35:50] David: always seem to welcome change or encourage change for myself because I just, I get, I think I get kind of bored with things if...

[00:35:59] David: Things are going well. Um, I mean, I know I'm, I've been very lucky with things going well. Uh, just, just things like the, the making the same how to videos for years just gets a little stale. And thankfully the views went down and it caused me to look and see, well, oh, what, what should I do if I want to keep doing this?

[00:36:26] David: What should I do? And, and made some changes and things are working. Some things don't work, but. I welcome change. I, I, this goes back to just like living at home with my parents and I would just rearrange the bedroom every once in a while just because change just feels, feels really good. It's like a, it's a reset.

[00:36:45] Bob: I never even thought about that. Yeah. Interesting. 

[00:36:47] David: Yeah. Yeah. I, I, I've, I don't, I don't have like a gut punch story that I can think of or that I really want to. Sure, but, um, just, just little things like Jimmy says, taking a step back and then, and then going forward. So there was a, I was talking to my brother a couple of weeks ago and he's like, these particular videos, they do really well for you.

[00:37:13] David: Why don't you keep making them? I'm like, that's because I don't, I don't feel good. They don't feel like the thing that I want to do. I, the videos that I really want to do, sometimes they don't work, but I know that there's, there's a way to make them work. I just, I gotta keep. Pushing for them. So I want change and I know that this YouTube thing isn't going to last forever.

[00:37:36] David: So there's going to be a huge change for me some somewhere down the road. And so I'm actually behind the scenes working on that. I think possibly real estate or investments is, uh, is, is the next chapter in my life. Hopefully that's not the main income for a long time. Cause I want to keep doing what I, what I do, but.

[00:37:55] Bob: Yeah. Well, it's interesting too, like even thinking about that, you know, as you, as you look at an alternative future and you start trying to build that thing up, whether that other thing is the main income source or not, it actually can afford you the Potential to continue to make videos with less pressure.

[00:38:18] Bob: Yeah. If the videos don't have to be 100 percent of your income, then like it doesn't matter as much and like maybe you'll enjoy making them just for making them, not because they have to do well. Yeah. Which is a totally weird thing to think about for us, you know? We haven't made videos just for the fun of it in a really, really long time.

[00:38:37] Bob: Mm hmm. Any of us, and it's just not what we do, but having that capacity, that sounds pretty cool. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, so I've had a few things over my life that, um, business things that have, you know, kind of, I've never had like a full crash to where everything went back to zero and I just had to completely start over, but I have had several steps backwards.

[00:39:07] Bob: Um, I had a business with a friend of mine. We had like a design company and we, you know, built it up at one point. We, I think we had, I don't know, 14, 12 or 14 employees. I don't remember. And we were working for this, uh, agency. I've told the story before, but they basically wanted to buy us for, um, to become their in house agent, like design, web design group or whatever.

[00:39:33] Bob: But when it came down to it, they bought us, but all they were doing was essentially taking us over. Now, I didn't walk away from that with any more money than I had before. I mean, I got a higher salary, but it's not like there was a buyout fee. So I didn't have any money, but the thing that I took away from that, what I was giving up was control, but what I was also giving up was responsibility.

[00:39:59] Bob: So then I didn't have to worry about coming up with... Money for those 14 or 15, 12, whatever people. I didn't have the pressure of worrying about their paychecks and worrying about, you know, are we going to be able to keep the lights on? And like, how do we, you know, now we have to replace the air conditioning lines again because some chump stole our copper in front of the building.

[00:40:19] Bob: You know, like that happened several times and we had to deal with that. And so that was a trade off in that moment in my life where like, no, I'm not getting really any more money for this thing that I've spent seven or eight years building, but I'm letting go of a lot of... The weight that just piles on over time with growth, you don't even see that stuff happening usually.

[00:40:42] Bob: But, and honestly I think a lot of that is what's been happening for me now for the last couple years. Growth has been great. Uh, the economy was going one direction and then not that direction anymore. And so the growth ended up having a lot more weight in a lot of different ways than I was expecting.

[00:40:59] Bob: And I didn't see it happening, you know. So, I think there's been a few things, um, like that where it feels like a step backwards, but the truth of the matter is, it's, it's building margin. It provides you rest. It provides you capacity to do something new or do something different. And... And then I've also had, you know, the situation where, you know, going to do what I'm doing now full time was a, a big jump.

[00:41:31] Bob: Um, you know, it was a, another financial mystery, whether it was a good idea or not. Um, but it was, it was letting go of the responsibility of making software for other people and being able to have the capacity to do whatever I wanted to, you know, so those jumps can either be. for relief or they can be for new opportunity or sometimes you just get Hit in the face and you just got to deal with it, you know, sometimes the engine in your favorite vehicle locks up and then you just don't have that vehicle for 14 months and you have to pay for that vehicle.

[00:42:12] Bob: Sometimes it takes a really long time to get that vehicle or, you know, I mean, there's, there's health stuff. There's all these things that, that are totally out of your, I mean, even back to the economy thing, the economy stuff is totally out of your control. So no matter how good you are with planning or with business, sometimes there's just forces that are.

[00:42:30] Bob: Beyond your control. And you have to figure out how to deal with those things. 

[00:42:34] Jimmy: That's when you say to yourself, What is in my control? I can get rid of this, I don't need this indulgence, I don't need that indulgence. Maybe it's time to sell this project which is not giving me anything. 

[00:42:46] Bob: Or decide, you know, of all the things that you do, no matter what industry you're in or what part of life you're in, of all the things that eat up, not eat up, all of the things that occupy your day, that occupy your mind, that occupy, occupy your bank account, what are those things need to be there?

[00:43:02] Bob: What are the things that you absolutely want, the things that you need, and then what's the rest of the stuff? Because the rest of the stuff, if it doesn't have to be done, it can create margin. Whether that margin is within your bank account, or within your head, or within your heart, or within your... You know, shop, I mean, clearing out things that are not necessary, it, it gives you margin, which matters.

[00:43:26] Bob: Um, so a lot of times you don't realize when you have extra capacity in your life, but you absolutely realize when it's not there. I do anyway. I can, I can feel that big time.

[00:43:40] Bob: So I've been going through a lot of change with this stuff. It's not, the change is not done. It's not settled, um, but I can already feel that margin beginning to return. Yesterday with, you know, with all of my friends moving on to, not all of my friends, three of my friends moving on to other jobs. Um, yesterday, my wife took the kids to school, and...

[00:44:10] Bob: Forby was working on an edit. So I knew what he was doing and you know, he's always being productive and everything But he was at the office and I was at home and it was very strange in the morning to be like Nobody in my family, nobody that I work with Needs me to do anything right now. Hmm. Now the truth of the matter is they probably didn't need me to do anything before But I had this pressure of like I have to be productive in in this Every minute.

[00:44:40] Bob: You know, 8. 30 this morning on a Tuesday has to be productive because if not, somebody else is going to feel it. And so I had this weird sitting there with my coffee, like, I'm going to go sit on the back porch and try to come up with an idea. I'm not going to do, I'm not going to, you know, if I don't, no big deal, I'm not going to stress about it.

[00:45:01] Bob: I'm not going to. Go look at email or whatever. Nobody needs me for the first time. I feel that way for the first time in a really long time. And I'm gonna go breathe that in. And relax a little bit. So, I don't know. I don't really have a point to this. I'm not trying to like say anything other than there's a lot of change happening for me and it's, it's hard and good and a month from now I will probably feel a different way about it.

[00:45:31] Bob: It will still be hard and good and not good and you know what I mean? It's gonna... It, like I said, it's not settled, but I just, I'm in the middle of it, have been in the middle of it for a while. And I would encourage anybody who has been. You know, knocked back to it, like, or, or knocked forward or however you want to look at it to like kind of embrace that.

[00:45:58] Bob: I know 

[00:45:59] David: that you are going to thrive through this and it's going to be bigger and better and I know that because if I was dealing with something stressful and a big change, you were one of the first people that I would go to for advice because of the way that you think things through and plan things out.

[00:46:23] David: And I, it's just, Bob Cleggett and I Like To Make Stuff is going to be bigger than ever because this, of what's happening right now. 

[00:46:36] Bob: Oh, I appreciate that. I don't know that I want that, to be honest. Yeah, absolutely. But, but I appreciate what you're saying. Okay, let's 

[00:46:44] David: remove the I Like To Make Stuff. Bob Cleggett will be bigger and better, personally, internally, 

[00:46:52] Bob: because of all this.

[00:46:53] Bob: Absolutely. I mean, I hope so. Yeah. 

[00:46:57] Jimmy: The other thing too is you have no option. You're gonna be fine. Yeah. You're an honest, good, hard working person. With a good family and no one's gonna let you fall. 

[00:47:08] Bob: Yeah. A huge amount of support around Yeah. Everything as well. Yeah, no doubt about that. And I think a lot of, um, you know, with like, maybe it's middle-aged stuff, I, I don't know, but the last couple of years, a lot of my internal just reprioritize, reprioritization.

[00:47:26] Bob: That's a long word of just like the stuff like where my time is spent my my brain and heart are spent You know It's it's so easy to get wrapped up in just like I I care about this thing or I have to make this thing work or I have to You know, I gotta I gotta care so much about Thumbnails, because thumbnails are what cause the, you know, and like I, you know, I don't want to be occupied by that.

[00:47:54] Bob: It's a, it's a part of what I do for a living. And I have to think about it. To be honest, 

[00:47:56] Jimmy: I, I, I, the older I get and what has happened to me, the people who know me personally and Bob, you always laugh when we hang out together. I literally emotionally let go of a lot of things, like, I'm not saying I don't pay attention, but like, worrying about taxes, and worrying about healthcare, and worrying about thumbnails, and worrying about...

[00:48:17] Jimmy: I get to the point where I'm worried about it, and then I just forget that it even exists, and when people bring it up, I'm like, I don't care. I mean, it's taken care of, but I try not to. I remember right when we got out of art school, me and a few friends were hanging around at this free lunch job I was at, and it was talking about taxes and what, yeah, what if, and taxes.

[00:48:36] Jimmy: And I'm just like, Oh my God, these are like free thinking artists and they're so wrapped up in this idea of like taxes and what to save receipts on and. And I kind of made a decision early on, obviously I pay my taxes and I take care of it and I hire people to do it for me. But I'm not going to be emotionally attached to it.

[00:48:52] Jimmy: I'm not going to let it pull me down or give me that gut punch that I felt about it. You know, I just use taxes as an example. But there were several things in my life which I just emotionally let go of. Most, mostly because I have no control over it. And that's, that gut punch is, that gut feeling and that, that desperation you feel is because you feel like I have to fix it or I have to do it right or I don't want to do it wrong or I don't want to get in trouble or I don't want to All those things and then you like, you look back and you go I'm just going to do the best I can with what I have and I'm not going to do anything wrong.

[00:49:27] Jimmy: And then whatever happens, happens and whatever comes through that door, we'll just deal with it as it comes through the door. 

[00:49:32] Bob: And I think a lot of those feelings are, are based in fear a percent. I don't understand taxes and hundred percent 

[00:49:39] Jimmy: I worry about it's, I choose not to just worry about it unless it becomes a problem, then I'll handle that problem.

[00:49:44] Jimmy: Right? It's like washing dishes. You look at that sink and you're like, oh my God, it's full D, you know what? Let's grab the very first cup on top, wash that, and then deal with the next one. And then after a few minutes, it's all gone. 

[00:49:54] Bob: You know, I was watching, uh, last night, I've talked about them before, but the Wild Wonderful Off Grid is a YouTube channel, and it's this couple, and they live in West Virginia, off grid, and they built an A Frame, this beautiful A Frame home, like, it's beautiful, and they have a homestead farm, and they do all, and they've got, like, all these other properties that they've been renovating, and all this stuff, so they built this A Frame a couple years ago, and we watched them as they were building it from their homestead home.

[00:50:19] Bob: Nothing. On a mountainside, this beautiful location. And now, they're going back and they're adding, uh, another, like, wing to the house. On the backside of it, they're building a rectangular, like, two story, the bedroom wing. So that then they can convert the A frame into just, like, living space stuff. And it's so funny watching them last night, it's just a husband and wife framing a house from scratch of their own design.

[00:50:48] Bob: And the first time I watched them do it, I thought, man, like, they are figuring it out. You could tell that they didn't, you know, they hadn't done it before. He's an electrician and, um, they hadn't done it before and they were figuring it out and they would do things wrong and they would go back and they would fix it.

[00:51:02] Bob: And then this time, they're like framing... The entire house in a day or two and they're just flying through it and talking about it. Like, oh, yeah We're just gonna put the rim joists here and the thing, you know We got to put the dip dip and just doing it and I was like they've done this one time literally one time and they were Gung ho about it, but they still had to figure stuff out this time.

[00:51:26] Bob: They're just like zooming through it Because they have just a tiny, not tiny, they have a small amount of institutional knowledge about a thing that they would have been scared about a couple of years ago. And so watching them, it, it dawned on me in the moment that like a lot of times, at least me, I think all three of us do this, but at least me, I'm doing a lot of the things that I do on a daily basis for the first time and I don't typically come back and do them a second time, which means I don't Carry that institutional knowledge and that confidence into another thing.

[00:52:02] Bob: My point in all this stuff is taxes are a great example of a thing that just feels terrifying to me. I'm gonna do it wrong. I'm gonna miss a thing. I'm gonna go to prison because I didn't file some form. But if you do it once or you sit with somebody who's doing it, you realize like, Oh, okay. I mean, there's a lot of ins and outs, but that wall up.

[00:52:27] Bob: You know how to do it. It doesn't mean you have to keep doing it, but you understand it and you're not scared of it. So, I think one of the things that I've been, like, I don't know, hoping for is going back and redoing some things that I've done in the past. Going back and spending a little bit more time.

[00:52:45] Bob: I don't know if you can see, there's a, there's a cello behind me. Oh! There's a cello. A friend of mine gave me a cello and she played for, I don't know, 15, 20 years or something like that and just stopped playing. I played cello for about 10 weeks in college and I loved it, but I was terrible at it. And she recently was just like getting rid of this cello and so she brought it to our house and dropped it off.

[00:53:09] Bob: And so now, I have a thing that I just had the smallest amount of institutional knowledge about. Now, I get to go back and actually figure it out on my own pace, where I'm not getting graded for it in school, you know, all these things. But so, like, I'm trying to find things like that that I've just barely tried.

[00:53:28] Bob: And now that I'm creating some margin in my life to do things that I want to do in addition to the things that I need to do. I'm trying to find things like the cello that I can jump into and just like, just, I don't know, get, like, I'm not going to do anything with it. I'm not going to perform. I'm not going to record it.

[00:53:47] Bob: I just kind of want to get it. You know what I mean? And so I, anyway, that's a long tail from the taxes thing. But I do think that there's something to be said for being afraid of something and then just going back and like picking at it a little bit until you're not afraid of it. 

[00:54:01] Jimmy: I, I, I'm going to throw an idea out there and I think I talked.

[00:54:05] Jimmy: I told you this when we were together the other day. I think now is the perfect time for you to start your A Frame. I'm sayin it. Just sayin it. 

[00:54:14] Bob: Somebody else brought that up as well. A little 

[00:54:16] Jimmy: bit at a time. All you need to do is just do the first step. You know, grab that first dish on the top of a pile of dirty dishes and do the first step.

[00:54:23] Bob: I would 100 percent agree with that. Except... That building a house costs money, and getting that initial investment of just like, foundation stuff. You have the property, right? Yeah, the property is there, yeah, but... Somebody want to donate a house worth of wood to me, you can let me know. I'll get 

[00:54:41] Jimmy: started on it.

[00:54:42] Jimmy: I mean, I, hey, it's taken me, going on nearly four years building my horse barn in the backyard. And I know the struggle. 

[00:54:51] Bob: That is a, it is something I want to do. I do think it's probably something I will wait until... At least some of my kids are in college, you know, and like, start picking at it then, um, trying to do it before then.

[00:55:04] Bob: Although it would be awesome to actually include them in building a house that they can then use as adults, so that would be pretty cool too, 

[00:55:10] Jimmy: so, I don't know. Just, just look, do it in like ten phases, and just price out those ten, and only worry about that phase. Because once that's done, you don't have to worry about 

[00:55:19] Bob: it again.

[00:55:20] Bob: Oh yeah, I mean, I know what the phases are. At least for you. I 

[00:55:24] Jimmy: mean, I'm only suggesting this because me and Howard were talking about this the other day. You can take out a construction loan. You know, and then you have that money and you just pay it back. And this way you're not worrying about anything.

[00:55:34] Jimmy: You're just worrying about where to come up with that loan payment. 

[00:55:38] Bob: Not worrying about anything. Except for paying. 

[00:55:40] Jimmy: No, I mean, instead of paying 10, 000, you know, out of pocket for a foundation, you only have to come up with a, you know, 1, 000 payment that covers everything. You know, that might, and then, you know, when, when things flip or things go better, you just pay it off quicker.

[00:55:56] Jimmy: This is what usually what I do. Anytime I take any sort of financial aid on anything, I'm like, you know what, okay, I just have to hunker down and pay that minimum. I pay that minimum, but when things get better, I throw two, two payments in the mail for one month or three payments in the mail for one month if I'm doing really good.

[00:56:10] Jimmy: Yeah. And then what happens is every time I get that bill, it says, nothing's due, nothing's due, nothing's due. The next payment is July 2024, you know, that's like, I open my car and just get further and further ahead. And then if I need to take a break, I can take a break. I always throw something in the mail.

[00:56:28] Jimmy: Might not be the full payment that's due, but since I'm so far ahead on, you know, a couple of things, I do have that stretch so that when I was able to pay with money. Now that I'm in the life of a freelancer, now that things are low, I can, I can relax a little bit.

[00:56:46] Jimmy: Just a suggestion. 

[00:56:47] Bob: Yeah, yeah. I mean, I would love to, and I, I think it's, it's still something I'm going to do at some point, but it's... Every time I think about doing another big thing, I think of the Gia, the poor Gia, sitting out there. And you love that, of course. And I'm like, eh, I should probably make a little more progress on that 

[00:57:03] Jimmy: first.

[00:57:03] Jimmy: Eh, just move every little thing. Thing along a little bit at a time. 

[00:57:07] Bob: That's true. A any other thoughts on this? I don't wanna drag out or anything, and I didn't really have anything to accomplish with talking about it other than just pointing out that everybody 

[00:57:15] Jimmy: No. Well, you know, I, the what I'd like to point out, and it's only because I'm my, my friend, I was talking about there's a, a certain shame attached to it and there shouldn't be.

[00:57:27] Jimmy: Mm-Hmm. It's, it's a tough, it's a gut punch. And I've been there, I know the shame I felt where I'm like. Oh, everybody thinks I'm this, like, millionaire toy guy, and I gotta turn around and say, I'm giving up my lease on my shop because I can't afford the next year's worth of rent. I have five employees.

[00:57:40] Jimmy: They're all going to go do their own thing now because they can't afford to keep paying. And then how am I going to make a living just in one little tiny basement shop? I moved from a ground floor, 3, 000 square foot, drive in garage to a basement of a tenement building. And that's where I started my next career, which was, which led to my basement shop.

[00:57:59] Jimmy: And before, I don't know if I ever made this clear, before I had the basement city shop that everybody knows from the beginning of my YouTube, I was in an above ground shop as big as the one I'm sitting in now. In Manhattan, with a drive thru, me and my, I had my Cadillac parked in there, my brother had his Harley Davidson parked in there, everybody thought we were the drug dealers, we were like Miami Vice, everything was going good, and we had all of our clients that were giving us, we would, the way we work with clients is we do their package design, product development, and prototyping, and invention, in some cases, sometimes they came to us with the invention, and we would handle all that for them for, As much as 10, 000 a month, so that we were getting checks for 10, 000, 12, 000 a month from various clients.

[00:58:41] Jimmy: And they would hire us so that they wouldn't have to staff up and put people on staff. They would just say, if they give us 5, 000 a month, we give them all the support they need for their backroom. Package design samples and one by one they would what what began to happen was China factories would be like hey We'll do all that if you're gonna bring this product here and have it made here.

[00:59:03] Jimmy: We'll do everything you need We'll do your package design your prototyping where when we first started that business All that was done in America and then we would just literally bring the only product that needs to be manufactured to the factory. The factory started saying, we'll handle everything for you just to get job security with that.

[00:59:20] Jimmy: Because if you just go to a factory with a widget and say, here it is, handle it. And they go, uh, okay. And then you're handling, but you take that same widget to six factories. Now they all know they're competing against each other. But if the factory says, hey, I'll handle everything for you for free. So I have job security that when this product gets made, you're going to keep it here.

[00:59:37] Jimmy: You're not going to go shop somewhere else. All right. And so that started happening in the 90s and slowly one by one all of our clients kind of dissipated. And we had nobody that was going to pay them the overhead we had and we had to just downsize. But the point I'm making is like downsize from what seemed like this great career that was never going to end.

[00:59:55] Jimmy: I remember having an argument with a girlfriend at the time and she goes, your life is established. This is it for you. You're going to be a toy inventor until you retire. And like, I always think about that because That was such another lifetime ago. That was a whole nother human being. Everything about that life, that style, everything was completely somebody else.

[01:00:14] Jimmy: Then I downsized, I got this little tiny basement shop for 400 a month, and I built a whole new career in that basement shop, which leads me to right where we are now. And if things kept going, I would have been this weirdo toy inventor, trying to figure out how to use... 

[01:00:30] Bob: Now you're just a weirdo. 

[01:00:33] Jimmy: No, a lot of my toy inventor contemporaries didn't really make the change and get Steve Casino is the only one that did.

[01:00:40] Jimmy: Steve Casino is the peanut maker, peanut guy. I love his art. Steve's amazing. He was always a natural artist anyway, but he just loved toys. And now he, he does, he combines them. So Steve is the only one I know from the toy business besides me. That's been able to make the change into. The new world of social media and using interior damage.

[01:00:59] Jimmy: And Steve has a whole new career. He, Steve is just a peanut guy. Instead of him trying to sell ideas, he is the idea. Everything he does is he's marketing himself. And I'm really happy to see cause Steve was such a nice guy. I couldn't happen to a better guy, but he made it happen because. He saw the writing on the wall.

[01:01:15] Jimmy: Long story short, step back to go forward and you shouldn't feel any shame about it. Everybody listening. 

[01:01:24] Bob: I agree with that. Any last thoughts, David? 

[01:01:28] David: Uh, I think we should take a step back and thank our Patreon.

[01:02:05] Bob: That's cool. That's enough for me. But people actually, like, get something out of it, which is also really cool. Um, but I was amazed, and I'm always amazed at just the kind things that people say about us just getting together and chatting. Yep, it's beautiful.

[01:04:05] Jimmy: Sometimes... 

[01:04:08] David: I forget that we're recording the podcast and I just think of this as my like Wednesday therapy session because I always come I always feel no matter what mood I'm in I always feel good after recording the podcast so thank you even if it's even if uh even if I'm not dealing with any problems for whatever reason I just feel so good after after the podcast anyway my you Pick is from Robinson Foundry.

[01:04:38] David: There's this video that I came across last night called I made a bolt with maze threads and it's basically a big bolt and the nut comes off through this maze and he shows the process of how he made this puzzle with 3d printing and then melting the 3d print through. Okay, I don't I don't know the terminology of the stuff that he used but it's incredible and it looks amazing and It's worth your watch.

[01:05:08] Bob: You know, I saw that thumbnail and it didn't even register in my brain what was happening But now that you say the name of it, I'm like, oh Well, that's crazy. Yeah. Yeah. Now I'm interested to watch it. And for everybody else, that noise that you just heard was Jimmy, um, sanding his fingernails with a giant piece of sandpaper while David

[01:05:32] Jimmy: was getting ready to finish. I sound 

[01:05:33] David: okay? Well, you sound okay, but there, is it raining where you are? Because there's been this constant, uh, hiss the whole 

[01:05:40] Bob: time. There's like a, yeah. 

[01:05:42] Jimmy: That's because I'm on the, I'm on the computer microphone. I just noticed because my plug is, so I'm sorry. All good. Oh well.

[01:05:50] Jimmy: Yeah. I just looked, I just double checked because I noticed the plug is sticking out of the microphone and the, the, the levels aren't bouncing. So if you guys haven't complained yet, then we might 

[01:05:58] David: be okay. Well, when you subscribe to the Making It podcast, you subscribe to raw. Making It. It's certainly not for quality.

[01:06:05] Bob: It's certainly not for quality.

[01:06:10] Bob: Alright, what's your recommendation, Jimmy? I 

[01:06:12] Jimmy: was going to say check out Millennial Stone Cleaner. That's Wade Fowler, he's the guy who came out and helped me. And then, while you were talking about watching your family building your thing, you know, we created that painting in our minds. Have you guys seen Truston Timber lately, what he's been doing out on his property?

[01:06:30] Jimmy: He's, it's great. He's got, he's got a new addition to his team. He's got his little daughter helping him. And, uh, it's amazing what him and his wife are putting together out there in the woods. And, uh, he trolled people a couple weeks ago. Did you notice that he put up a thing where he built... I don't think he meant to troll them, but it's, he's got a funny...

[01:06:48] Jimmy: What's crazy is that we're all builders and we can build something. If we build something that's weird or unusual, it doesn't matter. We'll build it again. He, Tristan put up a post where he used two standing trees as a foundation for a building. He's made, the two standing trees are still in the ground.

[01:07:04] Jimmy: Maybe they died, or maybe he killed them by cutting them, but he would've cut them down and used them as wood anyway. But the comments are bananas. Just everybody who's, who knows that's gonna die, the building's gonna fall over. It's just, it's crazy. But I thought it was funny because he said the reason to be being like, it's going to be fine, but it's just another, it's a funny thing where the people that come in and comment don't realize that they're being pulled in to create a dust storm to get some attention.

[01:07:35] Jimmy: Yeah. Check out trust. And he's an amazing dude who's, who's at making it? 100? Yeah. 35 years ago this week. , happy 

[01:07:43] David: anniversary. 

[01:07:45] Jimmy: Yep. Yeah. 35. 35 years. 

[01:07:47] Bob: Wow. Feels like only yesterday. He's a magician too. I did not know about that. I didn't know that. Really? You don't remember that at the, okay, so we're at making it 100 in Boston.

[01:07:58] Bob: We're sitting around after the event was over at Oh, okay. Okay. Restaurant. 

[01:08:02] Jimmy: I'm 

[01:08:03] Bob: okay. And so he, he pops over to our table, whoever we were sitting with. With a deck of cards and starts doing like magic right in front of us and it was ridiculous. I vaguely remember this now. And he's just going from table to table doing tricks for different people, different tricks, 

[01:08:17] Jimmy: you know.

[01:08:17] Jimmy: It's been 35 years. Yeah, it's a long time. 

[01:08:21] Bob: He was a wee lad at that point. Um, all right, so me, I have. One thing that I was going to recommend, but it doesn't work, so I can't actually tell you if it works or not, if it's cool or not. I saw a post on Instagram for a website called motiongen. io, and it's free, they said.

[01:08:39] Bob: So I went to try it, and it says the website is currently down for maintenance. Oh, is that 

[01:08:42] Jimmy: the one where the guy does like the, uh, the, like the pinpoints and he's circling? Everyone sends it to me, where it's like he's doing like a... You can build 

[01:08:50] Bob: linkages. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like a really complex linkage.

[01:08:54] Bob: Linkages. Yep. And two d and you can set the parameters for it. And so you can test out a linkage. And then I think you could even like create files and print Oh, directly from there. Interesting. I saw that. It looked really interesting. Um, but the website is down, so I don't know. And he said it was free. Um, so that's one interesting thing.

[01:09:13] Bob: The other thing is a book, and this is not gonna be for everybody. I get it. But it's a book that I have read. And twice now, I've passed it on to a few of my friends. It's called Becoming a King. And like I said, this is not for everybody, but it's about, uh, as someone who has faith, that's me. It's about using that faith, uh, to become the person that you should be to take care of the things that you have to take care of.

[01:09:43] Bob: And so it's made a really big impact on me in the last year or so, I've read it a couple of times. It's about... Becoming a good steward of the things that you have responsibility for. And so, if that sounds like something that you're even remotely... Would apply to you, which I think it would, could be applied whether you agree with my faith or not.

[01:10:02] Bob: I think it could be applied to you in really productive ways to make you better at who you are. So I just recommend that book to people. Take it or leave it. It's a good one and has changed a lot of stuff about. 

[01:10:19] Jimmy: Bob, say the name of the book clearly. 

[01:10:22] Bob: Becoming a King. It's actually not a great title for what it is.

[01:10:26] Bob: But, yeah, it's good.

[01:10:33] Bob: And that's what I got! You guys got anything else for this week? Hmm, hmm, hmm, 

[01:10:37] Jimmy: hmm? Hmm, 

[01:10:39] Bob: hmm, hmm. Okay, I guess not. Cool, well, I'm glad to be back. Glad to be recording again. Thank you. And uh, thanks for listening 

[01:10:47] Jimmy: everybody. Thank you. I'm gonna tell, in the after show, the ghost stories. 

[01:10:52] Bob: Oh, ghost stories in the after show.

[01:10:54] Bob: Okay, cool. I get to hear it again. Yay! Thanks for listening. No, I 

[01:10:58] Jimmy: didn't tell you this part. I didn't do it. Oh, okay. Cool. Thanks a lot.
