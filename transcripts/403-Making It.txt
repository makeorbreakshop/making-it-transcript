403-Making It
===

[00:00:00] Bob: It's very possible that there will be a lot of stomping above me soon because we have guests in our house and those guests have young children who are very stompy. The cast of Stomp. They might be here too. It wouldn't surprise me. We've had a lot of people. Um, but yeah, we're back after a couple of weeks.

[00:00:21] David: Is this all for your birthday? 

[00:00:23] Bob: Uh, not really. Not really. Not really. We just have some friends from Savannah that have come up the last couple years, this time of year, and uh... We just got back from Florida. We were in Florida last week and did a little visiting family thing and we, on the way back, picked up a friend of ours, a kid that's a friend of ours, from Savannah.

[00:00:48] Bob: We didn't stop in Savannah, we just like drove by and picked up this kid and came home and then the next day other friends from Savannah came here and so we've got a lot of people in our house, but it's good. Anyway, so if it's loud, you know, if they're stomping and stuff above me, that's what it is. Just, I've justified it.

[00:01:07] Bob: How are you guys? 

[00:01:08] Jimmy: I'm good, I'm good. I'm glad my racetrack event is behind me. Nobody's hurt. That's what I keep saying. There was a lot of people there. There was a lot, a lot more people than the previous three years. This was the fourth annual, and I'm definitely going to do it again next year. It was a lot of, a lot of smiles.

[00:01:26] Jimmy: A lot of people had fun. How many people do you think there were? I, I was asking somebody last night, someone said at least a hundred. Whoa. Probably like 75. 75 to a hundred at one point. Wow. At, at the, at the peak, which would've been at about two o'clock, three o'clock. The event is 12 to six, and by six o'clock is just like the, the close friends hanging around and the stragglers at, and it was fun.

[00:01:50] Jimmy: I finally wrapped it up. I had to post my video, so I was like, everyone's gotta leave. I gotta go home and finish my video. And , I, I was able to post by about eight o'clock. It was, it was a great day though, and we had one bad accident, but they had helmets on thankfully, and nobody got injured, just a couple of scrapes.

[00:02:08] Jimmy: Other than that, it was a great day, lots of, uh, lots of handmade, I'd say about ten handmade go karts, and then a lot of, even more than maybe like fifteen, ten or fifteen ones that were Facebook market buys, like within the previous couple days. It's a little fix em uppers and a couple of real mods, like, that's probably what I'm going to do next year.

[00:02:29] Jimmy: I'm probably going to buy one and mod it and build it from scratch. It was a great day though. It was great. A lot of, a lot of people trading stuff. I always encourage people to bring stuff to give away. And I ended up, I bought a go kart a couple days before. I said to Rob, I go, let's spend a thousand bucks and buy two, two go karts.

[00:02:48] Jimmy: See what we could find and we only ended up finding one just because of our time we were both limited with our time We found one go kart and the guy said all it needs is a clutch So we kind of bought it sight unseen, you know, it needed a clutch, it needed everything And so it was like whatever we took it and I figured we could all wrench on it at the track It does take place, a lot of people fixing up go karts straight there on the track at the back shop.

[00:03:09] Jimmy: Turns out nobody touched it, and at the end of the day, this kid Mason, who's come up here a couple times, we were all hanging out and talking at the end of the day, and we turn and look, and Mason's sitting in the car dreaming, and we all look, we go look at him. He's like sitting, it was like a, it was like a little enclosed, like.

[00:03:23] Jimmy: Nascar, it was all enclosed, so it had like a roof and everything, and you gotta climb in it sideways. And he's sitting in it, we were all laughing, and I was like, Mason, you like that? He's like, yeah. I go, you can have that. It's yours. He's gotta bring it back next year, repair it and put it together. That's awesome.

[00:03:39] Jimmy: Yeah, so, it was a good day. It was a really good day. And that's, uh, like next year we're gonna put up some, a little bit more rules, guard rules, and I might actually try and get event insurance for the day, just in case. And maybe I'll get an ambulance and wait. Maybe. Maybe. We'll see. We'll see how I feel.

[00:04:00] Jimmy: Those things are dangerous. Yeah. Ambulances are too dangerous. I know I might not have it then. 

[00:04:07] Bob: You should just get the ambulance drivers to race on the track with you so they have a reason to be there, you know. That's a good idea. And you don't have to pay them. It's weird when an event like that goes from, you know, like, let's just get together and hang out, to now it's big enough that you have to think about this other stuff.

[00:04:25] Bob: The safety and just management and... You know, different types of people, and different opinions, and different, 

[00:04:33] Jimmy: it's all mixed. The I bring this up to anybody, the first thing they say is, Do you have insurance? I said, No. They're like, You're crazy. I'm like, Whatever, I'm just having fun. And I did put up a sign, I know it doesn't mean anything.

[00:04:44] Jimmy: It's just a sign that says, You enter this area at your own risk. You understand the risks involved. Racing on the track. And it's a sign, you gotta walk by to get through the fence. Well, what we 

[00:04:53] David: do at the races is, we sign a, everybody has to sign a waiver. at every race and saying you are liable for this is a dangerous sport you are liable for your own safety and medical whatever so yeah 

[00:05:08] Bob: that might be a way around it I 

[00:05:09] Jimmy: did that year one but then all of a sudden it was just like a wave of people and I had like three people sign it and I was like forget it I know it's and that's why I figured I put up like a general area because we do that it's like a general release form when you're filming in a crowd it's like if you're gonna Stand in this area.

[00:05:22] Jimmy: You might be on film. I said, if you're gonna stand on the side of the fence, you're taking your own risk, your own liability. But I know that doesn't really mean anything. And lawyers listening right now are yelling at the computers . But next year I'll try and be figure out something more formal. Yeah. I have to, it's, it's important if it's gonna keep growing and, and it is a great event because.

[00:05:43] Jimmy: Some people show up with things that they made that they're in the process of making that don't even go on the track and you know that's totally encouraged too, they don't necessarily have to drive it. It's all about creativity and just getting outside your comfort zone and a lot of guys who never made a go kart or played with one are like, I'm going to figure this out.

[00:05:58] Jimmy: I'm going to get an engine, I'm going to figure out how to connect it to an axle, I'm going to figure this out. And that's really what it's all about, more than going 80 miles an hour on a tiny little track. Which some people, that's all it's about. But that's cool too. Yeah. As long as they race alone and nobody else is on the track with them.

[00:06:14] Jimmy: Them

[00:06:18] Bob: If you race alone, you always win. There's a T-shirt for you, 

[00:06:22] David: Don a media put out a, like a three video series a couple weeks ago on taking a little engine and seeing if they can get their little mini bike up to a hundred miles an hour. And this engine is like, it's almost the exact engine that I use in my racing Go-kart.

[00:06:38] David: And so each, each episode they're, they're, uh, adding some things and I keep. And I have a whole video on building an engine, so I was wondering if I was going to get any traffic from that onto mine. But each time they did something, I'm like, no, you got to do this! And I'm like yelling at my computer. And then they do it in the next episode or they do it later on in the episode.

[00:06:57] David: And I think they purposely slowly built up or did things wrong to create a little bit of suspense. And it was a fun series. Interesting. And they did not get the motor, the, uh, not a motorbike. What is it? A little, um, a mini bike, mini bike. Yeah. They did not get up to a hundred, but they got it pretty darn close.

[00:07:19] David: And it was super 

[00:07:21] Bob: scary. Hmm. That bike that they have, um, it was in the garage when I was out there. They had just gotten it and they hadn't done anything to it yet. And, it's the same one that I got my wife for her birthday last year. I don't know if you remember that. Like, it's just like a Coleman brand, you know, like a Walmart motorcycle.

[00:07:41] Bob: It's, it's very inexpensive. But they're a lot of fun. A lot of fun. Well, we've been gone for a couple of weeks. Other than, uh, than the racing event, what have you guys been up to? What have you been doing? 

[00:07:54] Jimmy: I've been working on my pool table. I'm getting the pool table sorted out. I'm going to try and have that done by the end of the month.

[00:08:01] Jimmy: And I published a video, uh, utilizing my new Thunder Laser, where I, I, acid, not acid etched, I electro etched a fake axe head. So the Black Raven is this very rare axe head that a lot of people like to try and find and buy. They're impossible and if you get lucky and buy one for two or three bucks from someone that doesn't know any better, you're very lucky.

[00:08:22] Jimmy: But a lot of times you gotta buy them for seven, eight hundred dollars. So I, I counterfeited one. In a video and I get more pushback on my Instagram posts some guy wrote me privately and it's like I'm I'm really playing with fire showing how to make a counterfeit my my name is in it it's a joke and we kind of argued back and forth I said so what you're are you're really upset about is that in 50 years from now someone isn't gonna remember who I am and it's they're gonna end up buying This axe had a garage sale for 50 bucks, so you're mad that that guy is going to lose 50 bucks.

[00:08:57] Jimmy: Because he said in 50 years from now no one is going to know who you are, and this is going to trade hands. Is that okay? So you're upset about somebody buying this at a garage sale 50 years from now and like losing 100 on a phony accent. Yeah. That's what this conversation is about? I was like, stop worrying about nonsense.

[00:09:14] Jimmy: So, what I've done, and then somebody else said, it might have been the same guy, he's like, well this guy does it all the time. I'm like, alright, so then fight with him. I did it once in my life. He's like, showed me some guy who has a whole Instagram page dedicated to making counterfeits. And the whole thing is like, I'm making a counterfeit.

[00:09:30] Jimmy: Would you like to buy this counterfeit from me? They're all like abandoned brands, 

[00:09:34] Bob: that's the thing. In the toy collecting world, this happens a lot. Where there's, you know, people at home who sculpt or kitbash together different characters and they'll make their own kind of counterfeit version of a toy that was out, an action figure or something.

[00:09:50] Bob: And then they mold and they cast them and they sell them. But for somebody that doesn't know that it's a fake, intentionally, I mean, you know, they're intentionally a fake. But for somebody that doesn't know that. They may think it's a classic toy that's still in the box and just happens to be brand new or whatever and they might buy it, but it's a very known quantity in that world that you remake old figures, you re card old figures, you do all this stuff as like a homage or whatever to the original, you know, so maybe that's just not common enough in that guy's world to be doing.

[00:10:27] Bob: For him to understand that it's a really, really common thing. And it's, most people who actually care about something being valuable know whether it's a true thing or not. 

[00:10:37] Jimmy: That's what I said, I go, people in the know know. You'll see other people in the know don't know. Some people don't know. I'm like, 

[00:10:41] Bob: alright, so.

[00:10:42] Bob: Those people are not going to pay hundreds and hundreds of dollars for an axe head that has a name on it 

[00:10:46] Jimmy: either. Yeah, that's what I said. But whatever, it was fun. I mean, I did it specifically to get the go to people like that. 

[00:10:53] Bob: Can you explain the process? Because I saw that you did that on the laser and I was really curious what the thing was.

[00:11:00] Bob: What 

[00:11:00] Jimmy: you do, you put a resist, something that will resist the electro etching on the metal. If the metal is exposed, it will be eaten away by the electro etching. I don't understand what happens there, but it works. And a lot of people told me by putting salt water and creating that electrical process inside of the bucket and creating chlorine gas.

[00:11:18] Jimmy: I didn't know that, but I lived to tell the story. It was a very open space, I wouldn't do it in a confined space. Take the metal object, spray paint it, and then I laser etched away what's going to be exposed to the water. Then you put the positive lead on that. In my case, I hung it off of a piece of steel, so the steel transferred from the positive lead to the axe head.

[00:11:45] Jimmy: And the negative lead goes on just a piece of metal that's stuck in the water. And you put it in salt water, and the electrons go from one to the other, and all the while eating away any metal that's exposed. And to get the fine detail, the only way I could do that is if I laser etched it away. The way, uh, it's the process that was used to do this exact same thing to the original axe heads, that's why it looks so on point.

[00:12:12] Jimmy: But the difference is, back in the day, they would have done a photographic mask. They would have done it photographically. They would have exposed a piece of film and then transferred whatever that emulsion is onto the axe head, which could probably still be done in a certain way. Like, for instance, if the axe head was perfectly smooth, you could probably silk screen on the all the bits of the graphic and get a nice perfect resist like that on the on the curved surface.

[00:12:36] Jimmy: It's a slightly curved surface and then just wrap up the rest of the axe with tape or something to keep it protected and then do it that way. So that might have been the way they might have done it in production. www. LRCgenerator. com And if you see an original Rave Black Raven axe, which is the one I copied, you'll notice that the etching is never perfect.

[00:12:56] Jimmy: I did a second one, which I didn't show, I only showed on Instagram, and the second one came out really bad, but a lot of people who know this axe, it's as good as any of the ones that have been out there from a hundred years ago. Even though it came out really bad compared to the first one, the first one came out almost perfect.

[00:13:12] Jimmy: Interesting. But it's an interesting process, and there are some people that discover this process and go crazy. There is one guy on Instagram whose name I won't be able to remember before we finish, but I'll try and look it up. And he does it all the time to hammers and axes, and he puts all his own branding on it, and it looks amazing.

[00:13:28] Jimmy: His logo is like a big hand, and I think he's in Europe, so he sells axe heads and hammers, all deeply etched. The longer you leave it in, the deeper the etching goes. And it really is impressive, you look at it and you could... Did you carve this? You know, that's what most people think. And a lot of people don't really pay close attention to the video, and they're like, I don't understand why you took a perfectly good axe and spray painted it red.

[00:13:53] Jimmy: What is what? What does spraying it red have to? I painted it red just 'cause it looked good on camera, but a lot of people are like, I don't understand why, why, why you painted it red in the restoration process. They don't even understand that I need to do a video where I explain it, but they don't understand that I sprayed it red to create a resist to then expose with the laser and then the itch they, they thought like it was the original act.

[00:14:14] Jimmy: They felt like by the time it was done, that's what it looked like to begin with. I just showed it off because it was buried under rust. Oh, I don't hear 

[00:14:22] David: any stomping. I just hear roosters. 

[00:14:26] Jimmy: I said, should I let the roosters out? They didn't have water, so I didn't want to make them wait another two hours. So, I was like, you know, let me let the birds out.

[00:14:33] Jimmy: They'll stay on the other side of the yard. I'm on the, I'm on the extreme east side of the house and they're all on the west side of the house, but. Wow. They, they all walked over here. I'm sorry. I have two wraparound porches, one on the front, one on the back, and they always. Just hang out under the porch.

[00:14:49] Jimmy: I have 40 acres. They can go anywhere in 40 acres. I have two barns. They can go stand in both of those barns. They come right to the kitchen window every time. And I don't feed them from here, so I don't know what brings them here. It's funny. Sorry. 

[00:15:03] David: Crazy. But that's it. Well, that's good. I enjoy the atmosphere that they create.

[00:15:08] David: It's, it just feels, it feels good to hear a rooster. 

[00:15:13] Jimmy: I, I just did, I just did, uh, twelve voiceovers for this old house maker channel.

[00:15:22] Jimmy: And in every single one of them, the roost is crowing in the background. I can't stop, I gotta go chase it. We 

[00:15:30] Bob: went to, while we were in Florida, we went to some friends, uh, they have a little farm down there, and so we went to visit them, and they were showing us all the different animals that they have and stuff.

[00:15:39] Bob: And they have goats and, I guess goats and chickens are probably all they have. I don't they have a big garden and bees and all this stuff. But, uh, this rooster, like, I don't spend a lot of time around chickens. So, I don't have a big concept of how big chickens are or how big they can get or whatever.

[00:15:58] Bob: They had this rooster that was massive. It was scary. Like, I wouldn't have wanted to go in the pen and it got me thinking about you and I'm like, Does Jimmy actually have to fight these giant, like, feathery monsters all the time? I don't know if yours are as big 

[00:16:14] Jimmy: as this one. No, well we have, the only, roosters can obviously be aggressive and I have two, I have one full large rooster.

[00:16:22] Jimmy: He's a, he's a big one and two minis. They're a species that, uh, I don't know what the species is, but they're smaller, much smaller. And the one that constantly makes so much noise is the smallest one. And he's the one who's the most aggressive. So it's funny. It's almost cartoonish where he like beats up on you.

[00:16:38] Jimmy: And I think I told this on the podcast about three months ago. I was showing my friend the Russo, I'm like, he's the aggressive one, and I kind of kicked him a little bit, not hard, like I just kind of stuck my foot out for him, and he came at me and attacked me, and his spike that's on his ankle got stuck right in my shin bone, and then he fell, he got hooked on my shin bone and fell, I think I told the story, and then immediately I had severe pain right down the front from my knee down to the top of my foot, and I was like, Oh, no, that's it.

[00:17:03] Jimmy: I'm going to lose my foot to a chicken kick. I thought I was going to get a bone infection and it took about seven days for that severe pain to go away. I thought I had infected my bone with a chicken spike. Just being like, oh, look at how aggressive he is. He's fun to annoy. And then here he is, like, removes my foot in one swift kick.

[00:17:22] Jimmy: Wow. Yeah. So you do got to be careful. Those spikes can hurt. I'm going to go on mute for a second because he's right outside the window. I might go 

[00:17:34] David: outside and kick him. David, what have you been up to? Uh, I don't have a video coming out this week because we're kind of prepping the shop for the next project, but a couple days ago we put out the IKEA metal cabinet transformation.

[00:17:47] David: We, I think it came out really good as like, it's my favorite project as far as like project and video combination. Hmm. And we did, we took a, just a metal IKEA cabinet and we. I added a whole bunch of wood to it and turned it into a drink cart and it was, it was super fun. So that is out on my channel. No, not this week, but the next week I think we have our television where we're combining three TVs into one big window.

[00:18:18] David: and so this week I'm kind of prepping the one of the shop walls we've got a bunch of cherry paneling that's gonna go up on the one wall and so it looks like super 70s on one wall and then I'm kind of redoing a bench just just for the video so it kind of looks like it's somebody's den where we're adding this this window where there wouldn't typically be a window so a lot of effort going into what's gonna be the background for this for this thing but it's gonna make the shop look cool it's gonna lighten it up a little bit because that wall vid

[00:19:00] Bob: Cool. Yeah. I don't think we're going to have a video this weekend either, uh, being gone, uh, last week and then holiday during this week. Yeah. It just, uh, it's kind of hard to get it all done. I'm working on a project that we'll have in a week or so, but it's not there yet. But the fun thing was, I can't wait to show this to everybody, but we shot before I left, we shot a really fun intro for this upcoming video.

[00:19:26] Bob: Um, and it was like. We've done a couple of times where we, instead of doing it more straightforward, Hey, this is what the project is going to be today. It's like a kind of a mini movie thing at the beginning. And so we, we spent the whole day with the smoke machine and a bunch of lights and made like a really fun little.

[00:19:47] Bob: Setup intro thing for this video and it turned out great. So I'm really excited to show that off, but it'll be a couple weeks But yeah, I've been traveling a whole lot. And so I haven't really done much But on Monday, so we got back late Sunday night and on Monday I had two 3d printers show up on the same day and So part of my Monday was assembling printers and One of them was one that I ordered a long time ago as the Prusa XL and they just started shipping recently and it's, this thing is so big.

[00:20:25] Bob: The reason I'm bringing it up is because these are both kind of unique printers to printers that I've ever used before, but I wanted this one because it is so big. And it's way bigger than I was expecting it to be. I have to assemble it, so I'm not done. Yeah, I can't, I haven't used it yet. But it's big enough that you could print Golly, I don't even know how how to even tell you what the measurements are.

[00:20:48] Bob: But it's big enough that you could print like a full size helmet inside of it in a single piece. Oh, yeah. Like, in every dimension. 14 inches cubed, maybe bigger than that. I don't really know. I didn't measure the thing, but it is very stout, very heavy. Um, so I'm in the middle of putting that one together.

[00:21:07] Bob: And then the other one I got was, uh. Um, this company called Bamboo Labs reached out and they've got a printer that they, um, it's gotten pretty popular and they wanted to send me one. And I get a lot of emails from 3d printing companies like, Hey, you know, can, can we send you their printer? And all you have to do is a 15 minute review video or something like that.

[00:21:29] Bob: No, I'm not going to do that. But this company reached out and I had heard about these printers. And so my initial response was. I, you probably want to review, we don't really do that. Sorry. And it was interesting because the guy responded with, I don't want anything from you, I want to send you a printer.

[00:21:45] Bob: And if you like it, then send me an email back. And we'll talk about maybe sponsoring a video or something in the future. And I said, well, just to be clear, you're going to send me a printer that I get to keep. And there's no expectation, because a lot of times people will be like, you know, they'll say that, but then if you don't like it, you have to send it back to them or some, or they get a follow up.

[00:22:05] David: Hey, did you get the chance to use that thing? Yeah. In a video? 

[00:22:11] Bob: Yeah, exactly. Did you talk about us for 25 minutes in the middle of another thing that you were doing? Um, but. They were really plain about, like, we don't, we don't want anything from this. If you like it, use it for a while. If you like it, then call us back.

[00:22:28] Bob: I was like, oh, well that's cool. 

[00:22:31] David: I have a question about the, the, the big one. Let's say you are going to print a, a helmet. Is, um, obviously the vantage... The advantage of the big printer is just one print, but is there any kind of warpage on something that big? Is there still an advantage to doing it in, in pieces and then putting it together?

[00:22:50] Bob: Yeah, I mean, it's always a possibility, but it mostly depends on the material that you're using. So some will have a tendency to warp more than others. Is it a resin or is it a extruder? No, it's, it's an FDM printer. Um, but this one is, FDM is, uh, squirty out plastic one. 

[00:23:10] Jimmy: Squirty up. Yeah. FDM means filament diddly diddly 

[00:23:14] Bob: diddly bit.

[00:23:14] Bob: Uh, yes. Cool. I can't think of what it means right now. That's too early. Oh, man. Filament discordy machine. I don't remember off the top of my head. And if you ask me in 10 minutes, I'll be able to remember. I'll look it up. But I can't right now. Um. So, depending on the material, uh, you, it's more likely or less likely to warp over something that big, but now they've kind of got, you know, printers to where they're cooling the space at a certain, or not cooling, they're, they're cooling the, um, printhead.

[00:23:53] Bob: Fused deposition modeling is not what I would have remembered. So, there you go.

[00:24:03] Bob: Anyway, they're pretty good at cooling and this machine is partially enclosed. The top is open, but it has a back and sides and that helps, you know, kind of cradle some of the heat around the thing that has a heated bed. So always a possibility, but anyway, this Bamboo Labs printer that I got is, that's 

[00:24:18] Jimmy: the one that could discharge colors on, on demand too, right?

[00:24:21] Bob: Yeah. It's got four, it's got a thing on top of it where you can put four different rolls of filament in it. It does, I did a couple of test prints on it. It was very easy to set up. It is a legitimately like super well made machine. It's impressive. Glass front, glass top. Uh, powder coated metal enclosure.

[00:24:40] Bob: And it's got all this crazy stuff and I'm not trying to shill for them. I just was surprised at how impressive the 

[00:24:46] Jimmy: 3D DIY Dave is always playing with them on his channel. It's got 

[00:24:50] Bob: like, it's got a LIDAR sensor in the printhead and cameras. And so it goes down and it makes the first layer, which is always the.

[00:24:59] Bob: Whether you're going to have a successful print or not is almost always reliant on if the first layer is good. And so it goes down and it prints the first layer and then it takes the head Slightly off of it and runs over the first print and it uses the LiDAR sensor to see if that print is flat or if it came up.

[00:25:20] Jimmy: Oh wow, so it makes its own adjustments or 

[00:25:22] Bob: makes its own corrections. Yeah, or it checks to see and if it, if it sees a problem, it pauses, sends you a notification to your phone that says, Hey, you know, you might want to check out this first layer and verify that it's okay. Um, but all along the way, it has like some AI engine built into the machine.

[00:25:37] Bob: So it's constantly looking at the print and checking it to make sure it's okay. And it's, it's got all these sensors and stuff in it. It's pretty impressive. And I did one print with two materials and it worked fine. I've done that in the past with some other machine. It was really, really slow. This one seemed to be pretty quick about switching between the filaments and stuff.

[00:25:59] Bob: So pretty excited about using that one and trying it. you know, for some different things. They sent some PETG that has carbon fiber built into it. So it's like a strong carbon fiber or strong PETG. Don't 

[00:26:13] Jimmy: make a submarine out of it though, right? 

[00:26:16] Bob: I promise. But so I'm trying to think of some reasons that I could use that.

[00:26:22] Bob: Particular filament, something I could make for the shop that would be, that would take advantage of, of having some extra strength, you know, 

[00:26:31] Jimmy: in PET. I want to ask you just to clarify, out of my own curiosity, when you make a 3D model that has various colors in it, are those their own bodies? For instance, if you're in fusion, does every color need to be its own body?

[00:26:43] Jimmy: Even if the color is interdisperse, like say, for instance, like a Dalmatian. If you have like a thing that... Well, 

[00:26:49] Bob: it depends on, it depends on the slicing software, and I've not done a whole lot of this, so there could be details about that 

[00:26:55] Jimmy: part of it. And by the way, a body is, when you're in fusion, a body is its own...

[00:26:59] Jimmy: Physical element. Yeah. It's 

[00:27:01] Bob: like a three dimensional object and you can have multiple bodies that go together to make a bigger thing. Um, the way that I've done it in the past, well, there's two ways that I've done it. One was two different bodies. Um, and, and you load them in. At the same time, in the slicing software that I used, there, there's probably another way to do it, but then in PrusaSlicer in particular, there's a thing where if you bring in a single body that maybe it has text, raised text on top of it, or on one face of it, it will detect that And say, do you want to do a color swap from this point to this point?

[00:27:42] Bob: And it'll kind of detect like, it looks like you're making a sign. Can we help you change colors or whatever? And so it'll kind of help you with that in the slicing software. Otherwise you just have to manually say, I want it to go from here to here, or these are the two bodies that need to be these two colors or whatever.

[00:27:57] Bob: So it'll be interesting to see how that works with, um, Uh, four materials, I guess it's works the same. It's just, you have more selections or more bodies or whatever, but the other time that I've done it was on an old Ultimaker 3, which was the one that was very slow, but the two materials that I did, one was a support material called PVA and it's like PVA glue, but it's in a, in a filament.

[00:28:25] Bob: And so it's a water soluble. So you, you print the supports around the, the other filament object, and then when you break the whole thing off, you just put it in a bucket of water. And after a while, PVA just dissolves away and you've got your print with no support material on it, which is neat, but not terribly practical and took forever.

[00:28:48] Bob: So that's something I would probably do often, but you can anyway, so, you know, the only thing I've really done after being back from vacation was... Set up the Bamboo Labs printer. Messed with it a little bit and then started assembling the Prusa printer, uh, which is taking a long time, but hanging out with 

[00:29:08] David: people and stuff.

[00:29:08] David: Do you prefer the Prusa slicer as your're slicing software? 

[00:29:13] Bob: I do. Uh, it's really the only one I've used in the last couple of years, so there could be other ones that are, you know, better or newer or whatever that I just haven't even tested out yet, but I've been really happy with it, and I really like their printers, and so their printers are, you know, they have profiles for them.

[00:29:29] Bob: Very easy to use through it, so it just kind of makes it easy to think. But with this Bamboo Labs printer, they've got their own slicing software that I'll try out, and then I'll try to see if there's a difference. Profile for it, for PrusaSlicer as well. There usually are. Really popular printers get profiles for slicing software pretty quickly.

[00:29:49] Bob: But... It's, uh, it's been interesting this year, I think, and I may have talked about this before, but this year I think I've spent more time taking advantage of the fact that I have 3D printers. I've always kind of held it at arm's length, you know, and only used it when it was like the best possible or only solution for something.

[00:30:10] Bob: And now I'm trying to lean a little bit more into... I just should just use it. Yes, I could carve this thing on the bandsaw or yes, I could whatever this thing out of whatever, but I could just print it and then I could do something else. So I'm trying to take advantage of what we have around here. That's the way 

[00:30:26] Jimmy: the world's going.

[00:30:27] Jimmy: There's no reason to stop. 

[00:30:29] Bob: Yeah, I mean, I'm not sure why I, I'm not sure why I kept that away from. You know, the, the normal tool set for so long. I think it was probably a holdover from when I got my first 3d printer. It was a Kickstarter and it was a thing you had to build and it was terrible. But I remember making that video and like, look, I've got a 3d printer and all the comments were like, No, nobody else in the world has one of those, or, you know, like, I'm never going to have one of those in my shop.

[00:31:02] Bob: Like, why would I be interested? And it was all this pushback, which of course I understand. And there's still some of that, a very little bit about that. But I haven't gotten that kind of a comment in a really long time about 3d printers or honestly, or lasers or CNC's. Occasionally, you know, somebody will, will throw shade at the laser cause they're pretty expensive, but really I don't get that kind of pushback on stuff.

[00:31:25] Bob: Very much. Yeah, it's changed. 

[00:31:26] Jimmy: It's changed a lot. So like it was also new. I mean with the technology the home based technology is Unbelievably more advanced than it was and more accessible than it was. Yeah, when I say advanced I mean to say it's a little bit more affordable, right? Yeah, I'm a shop guy that's not trying to make a YouTube influencer career is buying this stuff and having fun with it 

[00:31:48] Bob: So, I need to use it as well, I guess is what I'm, you know, I'm leaning into that a little bit.

[00:31:54] David: So, uh, before we get into our topic, Bob, did you get your Plasma CNC table set up? Speaking of expensive tools. Did you get that cutting? 

[00:32:03] Bob: No, because I haven't been here. I got, right before I left, I got the compressor in and all the fittings to get it hooked up. And I started hooking it up, but that's kind of as far as I've gotten.

[00:32:13] Bob: So after my company leaves this week, next week, I'm hoping to spend a day and get it cutting, but that's where I'm stuck at. 

[00:32:21] David: Gotcha. The, the reason I ask is the whole time you've been talking about the plasma. CNC. I was like, man, I would love to have one, but there's just no room in my shop or whatever.

[00:32:34] David: And then funny thing is Stepcraft, the, my wood CNC router company, they have a new plasma cutter attachment for their CNC coming out this month and they reached out and they were like, Hey, you, we want to send you the, the plasma cutter to use in your videos. And I was like, yeah, I just, my CNC is in a wood shop.

[00:32:56] David: I don't have the, and it's just, it's too big to move into the garage. And then we've worked something out where I'm getting one of their smaller ones and then getting the plasma cutter on the smaller one. So I won't, I won't be able to do like. Big sheets or whatever. So I've been researching this now, wondering what I could do with it.

[00:33:13] David: And so my question for Jimmy is, um, how thin sheet metal can I cut? Like this is, I'm working on basically, it's, this has taken me a long time, but this piece right here, it's Sheet metal that was cut, laser cut, and bent by Suncut Sun, and I'm working on this like It's gonna be like an arcade style music maker type thing.

[00:33:40] David: Right. Can I cut really thin sheet metal on a 

[00:33:43] Jimmy: plasma cutter? Yeah, 100%. You just, you just gotta move, you can move really quickly with thin sheet metal. You'd be amazed at how fast it can cut thin sheet metal. Thick sheet metal, the thicker it needs to cut, the slower you got to do, just like anything. Got you.

[00:33:58] Jimmy: Absolutely. You can cut 22 gauge, you can cut really thin stuff. Absolutely. 

[00:34:03] David: I was just wondering if it was going to destroy the 

[00:34:07] Jimmy: edge. No, I mean you gotta experiment a little bit. I mean, you know, maybe you need to put an offset because it depends on how hot the cut is. Obviously you don't want it really hot for...

[00:34:15] Jimmy: A thin sheet metal, if you run it hot you might end up making your cut wider than you really want it to be. But with plasma cutting you end up with a little bit of a grody cut. You just gotta make adjustments for it and decide where and when. If you have new consumables on it, your cuts usually pretty good.

[00:34:33] Jimmy: But you do have a wide kerf and you gotta account for that. 

[00:34:36] David: In the soft... In the software, is there, does it account for the kerf? It'll show you where it is. And does the kerf change on your, on your settings, or is the kerf always that 

[00:34:52] Jimmy: size? The kerf seems to basically stay the same. I guess if you really, if you really low heat on a fast cut.

[00:35:00] Jimmy: For really thin metal, I'm sure your kerf is skinnier than it would be if it was wider. Because the more it hangs in the cut, the more metal is getting melted away. So, for instance, a really long... slow cut and thick metal might end up being about an eighth of an inch maybe wider, but really small it might end up being half that size really thin metal, really fast cut.

[00:35:21] Jimmy: So I think it's been my experience that the longer it hangs in the metal, the wider the cut is. But then it does show you in the software where it's supposed to be. Okay. What side of the vector? 

[00:35:31] Bob: Is there any warping if you, like can you use too much heat or stay in a place too long on thin material? You could 

[00:35:37] Jimmy: technically, you could technically keep it Uh, thin metal will probably flex from the heat, but that's why you cut it fast and you can keep it wet, you know, if you have a wet table.

[00:35:47] Jimmy: That's why wet will, when you cut it on a wet table and it's, the water's filled to the top, because a lot of times the water also sucks up the smoke and debris. It keeps it from blowing everywhere so it's like technically a little bit cleaner. You ever see guys that have plasma cutters in their shop with an open bottom table and it looks like the surface of the moon underneath it because they never clean it.

[00:36:07] Jimmy: It's just bits and pieces of metal and thick black scrappy dust. The water table will trap a lot of that but also the main function is to keep your material from Warping from the heat. So you can cut a piece and as long as it's all splashy and wet you can immediately grab it and it's most likely going to be cool to the touch.

[00:36:26] Jimmy: If you're running it dry, you can run the risk of making that piece of material flex. And it depends on, you know, if the flex is, is, is okay for what ultimately is going to get welded to something so the flex will be then bent back out of it. But if it's like a quarter inch or an eighth inch or three eighths of an inch cut.

[00:36:45] Jimmy: And you cut like a small part that gets hot like a thin piece and both sides of the cut, you know, equal a thin material positive that you're gonna keep. You could potentially get some warping in there. Hmm. Do you use sheet cam? I use Illustrator and I import Illustrator into the Torchmate 9 software and then from there I make my, uh, I make my cut.

[00:37:11] Jimmy: And what's interesting is, I wish all CNC machines were like this, is that you can, I mean, at least, I know some are. I know ShopBot doesn't seem to be, but maybe there's a workaround, I just don't know it. You can throw a piece of material on the plasma cutter, put the point where you want it, and hit. Set Home.

[00:37:30] Jimmy: That is your new zero and then you cut a piece of material, like you cut say a star out of it, and then you just jog the machine over to somewhere else and hit set zero and then cut your star out and jog it over and cut your star out. I wish you could do that on the big CNC machines. It doesn't seem like...

[00:37:47] Jimmy: It always just goes back to the original home, you gotta bring it back into the software, open the software, move that object around, and lay it on your sheet. It's just two different sort of working 

[00:37:58] Bob: paths. There are, um, Josh would be the one to answer this question, because he has figured this out on our big CNC.

[00:38:06] Bob: But he had to make multiple home locations for different things when we were doing the push sticks. He had the big table set up for different things in different parts. And so he had, I don't remember the codes, I think it was G58 was one of them, but I don't remember, but there's a couple of codes that you can like set alternate home locations.

[00:38:25] Bob: Now it's not what you're talking about to where you're updating a single home location, but... 

[00:38:29] Jimmy: Yeah, by just literally selecting, so like Home is wherever you want the head to start, and that's usually in the lower lower left corner of your cut. So when you're setting it up in the cut software You drag it to the lower left corner.

[00:38:42] Jimmy: If it's a circle, for instance, the extreme square around that circle is your lower left corner. And so, you know, it's, and then you can just run a dry cut to make sure you're on the material. When you start cutting metal, you end up with like the most random, raggedy pieces of scrap. I'm sure. And you don't want to throw any of it away, because it's almost, it's like, it's like copper or brass.

[00:39:04] Jimmy: It's like, you know, it's got a lot of value, and if I can cut a smaller part. So I end up with these pieces that have... 20 different projects cut out of them. And then, and then like I, then I, once it gets to a point where I'll just cut off all the parts that are completely no good and save these scraps that have a few multiple square inches of space that I can cut something out of.

[00:39:23] Jimmy: But you can just run a dry cut over it, but um, it just seems to be a little bit easier on, uh, the plasma cutting software versus ShopBot, I'm using ShopBot, so I, I gotta ask my guy Brian over there if there is that type of thing because... With plasma cutting, I'll make one star in the software and that's my cut path.

[00:39:44] Jimmy: But in, in ShopBot, I'll have to lay out the sheet and show 30 stars if that's what I want to cut out. And then hit start and it'll cut all those 30 stars out of my stock. It's just two different workflows and it would be nice if they could kind of be similar. Yeah. But whatever, I'm sure there's an answer to that question, I just don't know it yet.

[00:40:03] Jimmy: So, 

[00:40:04] Bob: we've been talking about, so far, um, Me getting a 3D printer from a company for free. We talked about me getting a plasma cutter. David getting a plasma cutter. Uh, Jimmy getting, I don't know, you've got a million machines. We get all these things for, not all these things. We get some of these things for free.

[00:40:22] Bob: And that kinda leads to the topic that you had. Yeah. So what's, what are we gonna talk about? Well, this 

[00:40:27] Jimmy: weekend at the racetrack, I met, uh, Jared came again. Jared's come a couple years in a row, and, and Jared, I hope you're doing okay. Jared had the bad accident. He's okay. He, him and his buddy collided. Him and his buddy Alex, collided on the racetrack doing like 620 miles an hour.

[00:40:41] Jimmy: But wow, they both walked away. No problems. But it was a little bit of an eyeopening experience for everybody. Like, okay, this is dangerous, like all day long. We're having fun eating hot dogs and goofing off, but Jar is fine. But Jared did say to me at one point in the day, he's like, I have an idea for a topic and he wrote it down and I don't have the note in front of me, but the gist of the note was basically, do you feel you're as creative?

[00:41:01] Jimmy: With all this in air quotes success versus when you didn't have as much success say for instance when you know My monthly budget used to be like 5, 000 a month. Like that's all I had to spend when I was started on YouTube I remember that because remember Taylor and I were talking about it in like the monthly budget was like five to six thousand dollars a month That's all I had to come up with when I first started 

[00:41:23] Bob: For, as a point of reference, that's a pretty significant budget for a lot of people, like...

[00:41:28] Bob: In Manhattan, I was living in Manhattan? Yeah, yeah, I just want to point that out. That included 

[00:41:33] Jimmy: my mortgage, and my rent, and my rent at the shop. I mean, of course, it was really more, because, I mean, that didn't account for food and stuff, but those were my hard costs at the time. I owned the car, now I have three car payments, and I have insurance payments for everything.

[00:41:46] Jimmy: I have insurance on everything, which is annoying. Long story short... Obviously, and I remember one of my teachers said it to me. My buddy Kevin, he said to me. The older you get life gets more complicated and more expensive and there's almost no way of stopping it. It just happens. He says you develop more credit card debt, you develop more car payments, house payments, insurance payments, life insurance.

[00:42:09] Jimmy: He said you just get on this wheel and there's no way of stopping it. I remember Kevin telling me that when I was in my second year at school in 1987. my second year in his class and we were sitting at the cooper union museum and we were having a coffee together and he must have been a little depressed about something but he just said life gets more and more complicated the older you get he goes just try and enjoy it as much as you can he goes despite the complications that are going to come your way And he leveled off, he rattled off all these payments, and I think about that every time.

[00:42:36] Jimmy: He must have just made 

[00:42:36] Bob: a big payment. 

[00:42:38] Jimmy: Yeah, and Kevin is 10 or 12 years older than me, so he wasn't that much older than me. But he was a big mentor, he still is. And I always remember that when I look at my monthly bills, I just remember Kevin saying, life gets complicated. He goes, enjoy the ride. So, as life gets complicated, do we lose our creativity?

[00:42:56] Jimmy: Or does creativity flourish? And that's really what Jarrah's... point of question was, do, does life get more complicated and less creative or is our life becoming, well I'm using the word complicated but really what he was saying is successful. Do we make more money? We make a lot more money than we did 10 years ago.

[00:43:14] Jimmy: Does that make my creativity stifled or does it make my creativity flourish? I like to see, I tend to like to see my creativity. My answer to that question I'll start is, I like to see my creativity and my successful life. In two parallel universes. Yeah, I could make crazy cool fun stuff with bigger machines, but the impetus for my ideas and the impetus for my creativity is still that childlike curiosity that, oh my god, look at what happens when I click this pen.

[00:43:46] Jimmy: You know, like, that's cool. What can I do with that? And, you know, every time I decide to make something, I always go. Okay, what can make this easier? Can I use a CNC machine or do I just go right back to the table saw? For instance, I made the legs of the pool table yesterday. I made the beginning of the legs, which is this, this, uh, trapezoidal pointy leg.

[00:44:06] Jimmy: It's a tapered leg, but it's got six sides. I could have laid that out on the CNC machine, cut it on the CNC machine, but I'm like, that's gonna take so much programming time that I don't really... There's got to be a simple practical way when you see these YouTube videos of guys working in India with these machines that have been recycled from a different country and they're all walking around with no shoes on and they make the most, they make beautiful products with the most practical, reduced, simple methods.

[00:44:38] Jimmy: And so inspired by that. Yesterday I made these legs on the table saw. It's a crazy glued up jig, like I just took some CA glue and made this jig which you'll see in the video to make these tapered legs from, from rough cut pieces. I rough cut the tapered legs and then because of the jig I was able to bring them into focus, make them perfect, each one of them exactly the same as the previous one.

[00:44:59] Jimmy: And that's just from watching these guys just do practical stuff. I could have just as easily... Well, I could have went to my CNC machine and laid out this CNC pattern with this tapered 30 degree angle on both 60 degree tapered sides and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I didn't have to. And so I like to think that my possibilities are, are expanded tenfold, maybe a hundredfold because of the financial success I've had, but I don't rely on it.

[00:45:28] Jimmy: I don't constantly keep Trading up, trading up, trading up. I'm also a little bit of an old school guy. I've spent so much time being poor that I tend to resort to those simple methods versus jumping into the CNC machine. And so I like to think that, yeah, my possibilities are endless. More endless than ever before.

[00:45:49] Jimmy: But my inspiration and the things that inspire me are the simplicity and the childlike nature of anything. Case in point, during the go kart event, there's like some, the one guy has, my friend Chris, the alchemist, he has a go kart that has a motor and a belt that goes to the, the axle, but he doesn't have a gas pedal.

[00:46:14] Jimmy: He just has it floored wide open. And what he has is a slack belt. So when you're stepping on the gas, all you're doing is pushing a pulley into the belt. That creates the friction just like a power hammer. So that's how you drive his go-kart. And you know how you stop? That's awesome. You pull a lever that rubs a sneaker against the rear tire

[00:46:33] Jimmy: Wow. And it's like a cartoon, but it's ama and it's built on top of a ladder. It's built on top of an aluminum ladder. Any chance 

[00:46:40] David: this was one of the carts in the accident? No. No, 

[00:46:43] Jimmy: no, no, no. . . The two guys that crashed were like, they, uh, and, and I know Jared's listened and said Jared. You and Alex remind me of guys that go from town to town, and you come in with like a souped up, you know, 1970 Chevelle, and you're like, this car can take everybody's pink slip, and you're like, you steal someone's girlfriend, and you steal somebody, you're like, you win a race, and you steal someone's car, and the two of you drive away in two Chevelles, you came in one.

[00:47:09] Jimmy: And these two guys seem like that, but in the go kart world. They show up at a flatbed, they both put helmets on, they take their carts off, and then they're doing 95 miles an hour. And I didn't even think like I could possibly blow a belt on my 1920s go kart. Jared's got like four extra belts with him, he had to rebuild his clutch one time, and it's just...

[00:47:29] Jimmy: Funny how these guys, they just seem like go kart hustlers. They just show up, and Alex always just wears a tight white t shirt that's never dirty, but he knows everything about motors, and Jared's like all covered with tattoos. They just look like two go kart hustlers, like they go from town to town, like stealing people's go karts by winning them in races.

[00:47:50] David: So, I don't know, it's awesome. I kind of think of creativity in two different categories. There's the creativity as far as design and aesthetics, and then there's the creativity in problem solving. And I don't think having any more money or bigger budgets has affected the design part of it. But I, I have to believe that being able to just Buy the more expensive tool or the tool that does the specialized thing might affect my problem solving creativity.

[00:48:26] David: Um, and I say that because like, Oh, you know, the CNC, well, you know, cuts things out super fast or you get the, uh, the Festool Domino makes like super fast joinery. Of course you could do that all by hand and I'll, I'll, I still get all the woodworking magazines and there's this, there's always like a, a reader submission thing where they could, Send in tricks and and and jigs that they come up with and I'll see these things and I was like Man, that is so that's such a Creative way, such a different way to approach a problem.

[00:49:00] David: I never would have thought of that. And I think, I don't think of that because I have the tool to do the job. As far as like design stuff, like I, I feel like whatever's in my head, I'm, I, I'm able to get out into the real world. It used to be harder with, you know, more primitive tools. It's a little easier now.

[00:49:22] David: And I think I'm more creative now than I was. A year ago as far as design and aesthetics, so it's uh, it's, it's kind of like a, a privilege and a curse to have machines that could, that could do all these things. Also I have no room to work on projects anymore because of all the tools. So many tools. So many tools, I don't even have room to work on the 

[00:49:48] Jimmy: projects.

[00:49:50] Jimmy: That being said, me and Rob, Rob Rojas. Works with me here at the shop. Rob said to me about a month and a half ago, he goes, we have so much stuff you don't use. Let's get rid of it and start over. And so thankfully to Rob, we just went around and we picked. I've gotten rid of, I mean I will by the time we're done, I will have gotten rid of 10 or 15 machines that I don't use.

[00:50:10] Jimmy: And a lot of the machines come to me because I bought that, but that comes with it, and a lot of times the things were donated to me. So, we've gotten rid of, and we will get rid of, a lot of machines on Facebook Market. Rob handles all that. And, just, Bernie was just here, I sold Bernie an old Shaper that I thought I was going to use in a video, and I've used with Bernie.

[00:50:31] Jimmy: You'll see it on Bernie's videos. It's an old antique shaper, which is the type of machine that goes like Whick! Whick! It scrapes metal. So, you know, just, I'm really looking around me and going, what don't I need? You know, I sold the Hurst, so, you know, as much of a hoarder tendency as I tend to have, and I'm a little scared of that, because that's how my dad is.

[00:50:49] Jimmy: My dad, my dad is a legitimate hoarder. Like, he might need a TV episode soon. But I don't want to become that, so I'm like emotionally trying to detach myself from some of these machines I've collected. Uh, but what's funny is, okay, is the more success I get, I don't go out and buy a Tormach 770. I go out and buy a cool printing press that I would, you know, where I buy an antique 

[00:51:13] Bob: car.

[00:51:13] Bob: Kind of the coolest thing you 

[00:51:13] David: can 

[00:51:15] Jimmy: find. But now with the money that I have, I have the resources to buy a truck that I could put on a trailer, that I could use my forklift. You know, so I've kind of gone into all these, like, kind of, uh... Practical mechanical advantages that I didn't have before. You know, so for me, it's like, yeah, I got a lot of technology, but I have these like sort of construction y, industrial help, which enables my habit.

[00:51:43] Bob: Yeah. So I have a couple of thoughts here on this and they're, they're kind of contrary to each other. Um, one, I, I just assume, and I could be wrong about this, and I'm saying it because I'm assuming it, which is not always a great thing to do, but I assume that there's a sentiment for people listening or people out there in general that like, your creativity should be independent of your, of what you have, like the kind of, the purest mentality 

[00:52:14] Jimmy: of it.

[00:52:14] Jimmy: And that's what I was trying to say, and that's how I feel. Um, 

[00:52:19] Bob: but I, I think for me, I, I don't think any, any thought like that, that your, your creativity should be independent of, of what you have available. Like you should be creative in, in every situation or with the most minimal, sure, theoretically. For me, if I, I don't see using a tool as a particularly creative.

[00:52:43] Bob: Thing. It's, it's using a tool, it's a means to a creative end. But for me, David, like you're saying, the problem solving of I want the, this pile of things to get into that object, or I want to figure out how to turn one thing into another, or I want to figure out how to create something out of. The things that I don't even have in front of me yet to serve this purpose.

[00:53:08] Bob: And so, the problem solving part of not just how to cut a piece of wood, not that problem solving, but the problem solving of I want a thing that doesn't exist yet. To me, the more tools or the more... Fundamental problem solving elements you have, the easier that's going to be. And so my whole thing, for me personally, is that I would just want to be able to accomplish anything.

[00:53:36] Bob: So the more tools I have for that, it's just more. Arrows in the quiver, kind of. That's the way I look at that thing. It doesn't mean that I have to have those things, but the more that I have available, the more I'm gonna take advantage of, which I think is what I'm talking about with the three D printing and the laser and all that stuff.

[00:53:51] Bob: Lately, I'm trying to take advantage of the stuff that I have because I've been pushing it back for that mentality of you shouldn't have to have a laser to be able to do it, whatever. Um, so that's one thing that I kinda, I think maybe I. Think about that a little differently than what I assume other people do.

[00:54:08] Bob: Again, that's a big assumption on my part. So it could be wrong, but I think being successful or I don't know how you want to say that, but being successful or just having the money to buy the tools that you want or having the tools available to you, or however you want to think of that. I think it lowers the barrier to accomplish your task.

[00:54:29] Bob: For me anyway, if I don't have to leave my shop to get something done, to get an idea into the real world, like that's awesome to me. And so the more success there just makes that more reasonable, more possible. The downside of it, the flip side of it, is that I've noticed over the past several years, the...

[00:54:49] Bob: Success and growth of our company has brought on more people. Just like you were saying at the beginning, Jimmy. It's brought on more cost, more salaries, more insurance, another property. All this stuff that, even when things are going well, it's still this giant elephant that is sitting on my shoulder that I am having to mentally balance against.

[00:55:19] Bob: I want to make a table. What's a creative way to make a table? Like a table would be nice. How can I think, you know, I'm trying to think about this micro interesting problem solving thing in front of me, but at the same time, I've got like, yeah, but there's salaries and unemployment insurance and, you know, all this other stuff.

[00:55:35] Bob: So the success of it and to keep it going and keep it growing You have that additive pressure, and weight, and attention that has to go somewhere else away from the actual creative thing that I enjoy doing, that got me started doing this, that makes it all possible, and so it's kind of, I don't know, that part of it I think is the bigger thing for me.

[00:56:03] Bob: It's just that my mental attention is not as focused on the creative part of my job as it used to be. And that's hard. Uh, so I think, my big answer to that question is not about, whoa, is not about, you alright? Yeah, I missed the button, sorry. Muted the second one. My answer to this question is less about the, do the tools make it more creative, or less creative?

[00:56:33] Bob: Does the success make it harder to be creative? And I think it does for me a little bit just from the sheer split mind thing where I have to think about all this other stuff versus the thing. So that's my answer. And I don't know how to get out of that. That, I mean, that's something I've spent time thinking about.

[00:56:51] Bob: You know, I mean, I could like fire everybody and shut everything down and just go back to me in the garage. That sounds not great. That's not practical. Yeah, but I don't know how to take what we have and the current success and the current state of everything and... 

[00:57:05] Jimmy: I think, I mean, you guys, you do it in the way where you guys take a trip, but maybe you need to spend more time tinkering by yourself.

[00:57:12] Jimmy: That's what you need to do. I think tinkering alone is really important. A lot of times I like being alone, and it's really where my best ideas come from. When I'm unencumbered, nobody's talking to me, nobody's asking me a million questions. People come and they go, where'd you get this? Why'd you do that?

[00:57:26] Jimmy: What made you think that? Why'd you do that? How come you did that? What is this? Why is that? And it's just like, oof. I gotta take a nap when they leave. Bye. 

[00:57:34] David: I think, uh. sometimes you just have to accept like this is just life now like I have chronic back and foot pain and I don't know that it's ever gonna go away so it's just it's just gonna be part of my life now and There's a comedy bit from some comic, I can't remember, but he goes to the doctor for his ankle and the doctor's just like, you've got a crappy ankle now.

[00:58:08] David: And he's like, okay, how do we fix it? And the doctor's like, no, you just have a crappy ankle now. This is life. It sounds like 

[00:58:14] Jimmy: a Louis C. K. thing. I think it is, yeah. He talks, he goes, I'm 50 years old. He goes, look at this belly. He goes, I'm going to go from here to abs. He goes, it's never going to happen. He goes, I'm going to get abs at 50.

[00:58:26] Jimmy: He goes, let's be real now. It's never going to happen. But I, the other thing too is the other side of the coin is when you do get a cool machine, like Bob, you're about to get the plasma cutter up and going. Dave, you too. When you get that, all of a sudden you're like, whoa, I could make knives out of saw blades.

[00:58:40] Jimmy: I could make this cool shelf bracket that I've seen once before that now it's in the power of my hands. So you have, it definitely unlocks new channels. So, I mean, the most important thing, if we're going to do any takeaway from this, is you can't lose that childlike curiosity and that childlike interest in trying to make things.

[00:59:01] Jimmy: You gotta keep that no matter what, no matter how complex life gets, you gotta keep that. But as life gets complicated, you do have more possibilities and you have more limits unlocked. And I can now make a shape in metal. I can make any shape I want in metal. It fits on my 4 foot wide table. Up to 1 inch thick steel.

[00:59:22] Jimmy: I think I cut 1 inch thick steel once. So it may be 3 quarters of an inch thick steel for a vice base for Lucas. But, without that machine, and then, like for instance, I said, I go, oh, let me go, I said to Rob, I'm like, We're sitting here hand stamping these ice picks, one at a time, you know, one out of every ten is a little cockeyed, so I put it in the drawer to give away for free.

[00:59:44] Jimmy: I'm like, you see these videos of these Indian guys making everything on these die stampers, I go, open up Facebook Market, let's buy a die stamper. Two days later, the guy's at Wasco Tool Company, Connecticut, the guy was a fan of mine, so he offered to drive it, and I paid for his gas. He dropped off this crazy die stamping machine.

[01:00:03] Jimmy: And we did like thousands of ice picks in one afternoon. So there, because it took me, it took me hours to make the die, but that was another creative outlet for me to figure out how to make a die that will put my logo on these ice picks. And in one afternoon my brother ran through thousands of them.

[01:00:19] Jimmy: Just by sticking it in and pushing the button just like you see in a factory. And so the idea of having money sometimes is the type of thing where it's, it's so used to doing things. With a, with a let's say money mind mentality, that I forget that I can just go to Facebook market and buy a good used old machine that's trustworthy and sturdy.

[01:00:42] Jimmy: You don't need to buy a brand new one. Yeah, yeah. That's a good point. I gotta remind myself that sometimes. 

[01:00:49] David: As I was, uh, As I'm preparing to get this, this plasma cutter, I'm looking up for ideas and I'm like, Oh man, I can make a bunch of little metal bins. I can just have it. I have it all cut out and then bend it.

[01:01:04] David: And, and then I see a couple of videos of people who just Draw it out and then use snips and cut it out. And I, I don't know why, but I never would have thought, Oh, you can just cut real thin metal with 

[01:01:18] Jimmy: snips. And you were never limited before, but now you thought you were. Yeah. 

[01:01:23] David: And I was like, Oh man. That would be so much faster than drawing it up on the computer.

[01:01:28] David: Well, 

[01:01:29] Jimmy: now with the machine, now you have the ability to make multiple parts, so you can make a set of drawers. Whereas you wouldn't necessarily, you might make two tin snippy ones and be like, that's cool. Look what I could do. One day I'll make 20 of them, but that's never going to happen. But now with the machine, it unlocks the potential to make a chest of drawers or whatever.

[01:01:48] Jimmy: Yeah. 

[01:01:48] Bob: Yeah. That's a good point. Yeah. I think, uh, you know. You don't need any of this expensive stuff to, to find a way to solve your problem. And I think that's the crutch. That's the thing where people might get into trouble. We've probably gotten into trouble where we think, Well, I don't have that one thing to do that one thing.

[01:02:11] Bob: There's always a workaround. There's always a way to be creative and solve the thing. Um, but, you know, depending on where you are and how you go about making, Being able to have bigger machines, more machines, something to do, everything you can think of, it might be a crutch. It might be the thing that allows you to actually execute your ideas.

[01:02:35] Bob: You know, it just depends on who you are and how you work. Some people like to make, you know, tables, and that's the thing that they want to do. They just want to make tables. And so they don't need all these other extra stuff to make tables. I barely ever want to make the same thing twice. And so I can't stick with a single tool set, but that just shows you how different, even the three of us, how differently we go about what we enjoy making, how we do it, how often we do it, how many times we do it, you know, that stuff's all different.

[01:03:06] Bob: So, it's a bit of a different situation for everybody, I think. Any other thoughts? I don't, we had to restart our recording in the middle, so I have no idea how long we've been talking, but... Thoughts? Anyone? Anyone? No? 

[01:03:21] Jimmy: No, I think, uh, you know... It's just, you just gotta remain creative regardless of what happens and I think if it's in your spirit, it's in your spirit, but when you do get a new machine, that spirit leads to being able to take that machine and use it to its potential.

[01:03:38] Jimmy: So that's my thought. That's a good point. 

[01:03:43] Bob: Cool. 

[01:03:44] Jimmy: Well. Like if you were a 10 year old and you were allowed to drive a car, what would that be like? Like, whoa. 

[01:03:50] David: I could go anywhere. 

[01:03:54] Bob: Well, big thanks to our Patreon supporters, who are still here, even though we took a week off. We're grateful to them for that. So, big thanks to everybody over there.

[01:04:03] Bob: We have a group of top supporters that are, they go above and beyond. They really do. So, big thanks to Corey Ward, Albers Woodworks, Works by Solo, Chad from ManCrafting, Chad's Custom Creations, Rich at Low End Designs, Odin Leather Goods, Sean Beckner, Scott Oram, The New Janky Workshop, Stu Morrison, Warren Works, Michael Menedjian, The Web Ranch Woodworks, and Crabtree Creative.

[01:04:24] Bob: Crabtree Creative sent us a message and it is a topic all by itself. I'm going to forward it to you guys to read, but we do have, we got a big message for him. So, um, but big thanks to everybody over there. Everybody gets the after show at every level. Um, and if you want to join that group and find a new person here.

[01:04:47] Bob: Addison Pochynes, Pochynes? I don't know how to say your last name, Addison, but welcome. Um, if you want to join that crew. You can go to patreon. com slash making it and join up for any amount that makes sense to you. Anything that you think we're worth or you have to spare. Whatever. We would appreciate it.

[01:05:08] Bob: I don't have anything to recommend yet this week, so I'm going to look for that while you guys tell me something that you're going to recommend. What you got? All right. Dave, 

[01:05:15] Jimmy: go. I 

[01:05:16] David: have, I have one here and, and then I have like a bonus one that maybe I'll mention in the after show or I'll mention here if Bob can't find one, but, um, this is, uh, it's from the BBC archive and it's the, it's called Spirograph Inventor.

[01:05:34] David: At work on his new creation. So this is from 1977 and it's just shows this older gentleman who invented this photograph, who worked at this toy company and it wasn't for him. He just wanted to invent things and he goes back home and then he's working on his new invention. Uh, it's just, uh, it's just.

[01:05:57] David: Makes you want to tinker. You watch this video and you just want to head out into the shop. And it's only like 3 minutes and 54 seconds. So take a little bit out of your day and go watch this. It's so good. Cool. 

[01:06:13] Jimmy: Right on. Um, I'm just trying to think of somebody that was at the event. Just give them some love.

[01:06:18] Jimmy: And, uh, check out... Chris over at the Alchemist on Instagram and you can see the go kart I talked about. He's been showing it, the development of it. He made it last year and this year he he upgraded it. It's the go kart made out of a ladder and he said when I first, when he first heard about the go kart event a year ago when he came to the first one last year, he said I wanted to just look around my shop and make whatever I could make with what's sitting around here and that's why he started the frame is on a ladder.

[01:06:46] Jimmy: It's hilarious. So check out the Alchemist. That's 

[01:06:50] Bob: crazy. I, I got nothing. I'll give my bonus 

[01:06:55] David: one right here. So, okay, this was totally by random chance that this video was introduced to me last night, but apparently they are shooting a new Beetlejuice movie. I... I freaking love Beetlejuice. And so the video, um, was this, this guy went to the town where they shot it and he's showing the buildings that they are rebuilding or fixing up to make it look like just how it looked 30 years ago or whenever the first Beetlejuice came out.

[01:07:25] David: And it was fascinating because so it's a real town. There's just construction crews all over this tiny little town. It shows the bridge where the car went off and everything and, um, how they got to re rebuild this, this thing to make it look like the original. And then when I was done watching that, he was at this little town a year ago and he was doing, and this video is even more interesting to me because he was showing like, this is where the Beetlejuice house was, but there's nothing here now.

[01:07:56] David: This is this building, how it looked before and after him. He was doing like. comparisons in the from the movie to to real life and then one of the houses there this lady had a whole bunch of pictures um from when they were filming so you know just film camera snapping pictures of uh all the actors and and set locations and everything and i was just completely fascinated by these two videos and they're just Hmm.

[01:08:25] David: So good. So I will put the link to these two videos in the show notes. Awesome. 

[01:08:32] Bob: Cool. Well, thanks for covering me because I don't have any. Um, all right. Well, thanks for listening to everybody. Glad to be back. And we will see you next time. 

[01:08:45] Jimmy: Thank you everybody. Love you. Have a great day, Bob. 

[01:08:49] David: Thanks.
