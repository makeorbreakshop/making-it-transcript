418-Making It
===

[00:00:00] Bob: Today, David and I are just going to sit back and let Jimmy do the entire show. We decided just now we forgot to tell him. So, have fun, Jimmy. 

[00:00:10] Jimmy: Hi, everybody. I'm Jimmy D'Oresta. Welcome to Making It. I was about to say Making Fun. I couldn't remember the name of the show. Oh, I've got so many different 

[00:00:18] Bob: podcasts and TV shows.

I can't remember the 

[00:00:21] David: names. 

[00:00:24] Jimmy: How are you guys? I'm tired. I'm still having my coffee. This is like the 15th word I said today, right now. 

[00:00:32] Bob: As soon as he got on the recording, he was like... This is the first noise I've made today or something like that. 

[00:00:39] David: And then went on to make a whole bunch of other high pitched noises we should have been recording.

[00:00:45] Jimmy: When I wake up, when I wake up, I usually warm up my voice by going,

I think I told you guys this years 

[00:00:53] David: ago. You're single, right? That's, you're not married. 

[00:00:57] Jimmy: Years ago I lived with a buddy of mine who was, he had ADHD and every other thing with initials. And I would wake up and he would just start asking me questions. He's like, what are you going to make today? What are you going to do today?

What are you going to do today? He was getting divorced from his wife and so I let him live with me for the summer. Every morning he would just ask questions to the point where I just started going... So he, every time he asks a question, I just stop talking and now that's become a ritual of mine. Every morning I wake up, I just like, I'm just warming up my voice.

So the words start to formulate. So, if you ever have an early morning with me, you usually get a little bit of that. That's just me warming up my vocal cords. Cool. Or if you start asking me a lot of questions when I start doing that, that basically means you've asked one too many questions. Yeah, 

[00:01:48] Bob: you've hit my limit.

I mean, Jenny does that too. Like, I'll get up in the morning, I definitely need a few minutes to just, you know, have some coffee and like wake up a little bit. And she goes, because she gets up before I do, she's like getting her day started and everything. And so as soon as I walk out, she's like, okay, so today we've got to take this kid to this thing and do this and drop them off.

And I need you to go pick up the thing and ask, you know, and I'm just like, I can't do it. I melt down. Anyway, what are you 

[00:02:16] David: guys up to? 

[00:02:18] Jimmy: Go Dave. 

[00:02:20] David: Uh, well, uh, I'm finishing up some bar stools right now for the new house. It's the very first project in the, in the rental. And they look pretty, pretty good. I even did a little bit of cushion making without doing any research.

I, I, I Bob Cleggated the, the cushion making. Oh, cool. Yeah. Um. 

[00:02:42] Bob: I'm not sure that I like that. Because that could mean, oh, I bobbed it, ugh. 

[00:02:49] David: When you talk about, like, diving into something without doing any research, so you can learn the ins and outs of something. And I felt like I had the basics, and... I also felt like I had a deadline and so let's let's just dive into it and if I didn't like it if it didn't come out fine I could redo it if I wanted to although I will say foam and padding is just Stupidly expensive.

Yeah, it really is. Maybe I'm going to the wrong source. Cause I'm, I'm, I'm going to Joann Fabrics or Michaels and... Joann's 

[00:03:29] Jimmy: is a little expensive. Maybe go to like a furniture store and buy a cushion you like. If you happen to find one bigger than what you need. Yeah. I don't know if that's possible. Go to like, uh, Bed Bath Beyond.

I don't know, maybe that's a crazy idea. But you might end up spending more money. Salvage something that already exists. Except Bed Bath 

[00:03:43] David: Beyond just 

[00:03:43] Bob: closed. Right. Yeah, they're gone. Gotta go to Beyond. So, what was your, what was your, uh, kind of process for... Sewing something like that without any experience?

No sewing, it's fiction. So, 

[00:03:56] David: um, made the bar stools, and originally the bar stools were gonna, was gonna have this curvy bent lamination top, and I never liked any of the designs, and so... I'm like, okay, I'm just going to make it flat and then I'll make a cushion for it. And the, so I just took a piece of plywood, quarter inch plywood, cut it to the shape that I needed.

Got some one inch, it's called new foam. I don't know if that's a brand name or a style of foam, uh, to the size of the plywood, took some cotton batting, wrapped it around, stapled it underneath, and then took the. Fabric or the cloth that I'm using, wrap that around and stapled it underneath. The corners were rounded on the, on the edges of the, of the plywood.

And so when you stretch it, it wants to fold up. So I'm like cutting off excess and I tried to make it as thin as possible while still giving it a little bit of cushion. So the, the foam was like an inch thick. So. Um, and it came out pretty okay. I, I would, I would say I'm 96 percent happy. The corners, I think could look a little bit better.

And then when you're stretching, if you don't stretch evenly along the edges, you get a little bit of waviness and it's not a perfect radius going, going around the, the 

[00:05:14] Jimmy: plane. That would help. I mean, if you had a stitch seam on there, that would pull more evenly, right? You, you said you're putting staples?

Staples, yeah. Yeah, so when there's a, wherever it's grabbing is where it's holding and anything in between it's pulling. If you had an even stitch all the way across, wouldn't that keep it from doing that? That 

[00:05:31] David: might, that probably. Uh, I guess it, I don't have a sewing machine. That's something that is definitely on the list.

You actually recommended one a few weeks ago that I have bookmarked somewhere. 

[00:05:43] Jimmy: The 303 is a really good one, the 303 from Weaver. It's about 1500, 1800. But I also say always go to Facebook market and get a 300 Juki. What you want is an industrial machine. You don't want one of those ones that come, you don't want one that comes in a plastic box with a lid and a foot pedal.

They're okay in a pinch. You usually see them on sets where people have to quickly fix stuff. But a Juki is a big industrial machine or, or if it's classified as an industrial machine, Singer obviously makes a really good. Industrial machine. Brothers is usually a good, like you want a big cast iron head with a table.

You don't necessarily want one of those things that clip shut inside its own suitcase. Those are usually too underpowered. The bigger ones can sew through two or three ounce leather, maybe vinyl, a couple of layers of material. You always know when your sewing machine is. We'll bind up when you sew two pieces together, then fold at one time and try and sew four pieces together.

And then if it binds up, the machine usually is underpowered. That's why you would need, like I said, something that's classified as an industrial machine. And you 

[00:06:50] David: have the 303 or you just recommend the 303? 

[00:06:53] Jimmy: I have it, I use it all the time. It is an amazing mid level machine. Sometimes those smaller machines that are either in a box or even a smaller capacity Juki or an industrial machine is really only for sewing fabric that you would find in clothes.

Like t shirt material or curtains or bedding. You want a bigger machine that can handle, like I said, a little bit of leather, some vinyl, four or five layers of canvas, something like that. And so a bigger Juki, and you could find them online all the time on Facebook market for hundreds of dollars, as opposed to the 303, which is about, like I said, about 16, 1, 800.

It's an amazing machine. If you can lay out the money, it is unbelievable. And it has a walking foot, which is also really important. The top foot pulls with the bottom. This will go to my recommendation by the end of the show. I have a really good recommendation, which I said years ago, but now I'm doing a deep dive on this guy.

He's amazing. But there's an episode he talks about the invention of the sewing machine, but we'll get there later. 

[00:07:51] David: Well, maybe I'm going to pull a Jimmy Diresta and say, Hey, Weaver, give me a call. Oh 

[00:07:56] Jimmy: yeah, I'll tell you have a relationship with him, don't you? I don't know. Oh, I thought you did. They reached out to 

[00:08:01] David: me a couple years ago to do a video, and then I replied, and then that was the end of that conversation for some reason.

[00:08:08] Bob: There is a, I just looked on Facebook Marketplace, we're live searching right now, there's one in Toledo, Ohio for 750. Which one is it, a Juki? A Juki. It's a DDL 8700. 

[00:08:21] David: While you have that up, just text me that link. 

[00:08:23] Jimmy: Okay. Yeah. There's usually lots to choose from, you know, so you might find one that's even closer and cheaper or whatever.

But a Juki is, uh, is a great machine. So many students buy them and then decide not to go into that career and then they're always available or... More often than not, you'll have factories that have overstock. So you have a factory that had... The staff of 30 people and now they only need 20 machines and so they're just selling 10 off.

And they're always good machines that have been exercised well. That's usually how you find them. In fact, this, this breaks my heart. There was, um, a store, I think it was Lord Taylor, one out of business here in New York, I think it was Lord Taylor. And, uh, godmother of denim, my friend, Christine, happened to be at the right place at the right time.

And she got the call, someone said, Hey, you, you use sewing machines, right? Do you want to, we got to get rid of like 25 sewing machines. And she said every one of the machines was like a 4, 000 sewing machine, and they were gonna get thrown away. They need, like the landlord didn't care. They wanted everybody out.

And this was like a big giant industrial mending center inside of a Lord Taylor, I think it was, in Midtown Manhattan. She said she took three machines. That's all she could take. And the rest of them, she said, they probably just got put on the street and thrown away. Most likely they get put on the street and you give them a couple of days and then they're usually gone.

But there's always situations like that where people have to get out. So sewing machines, although you could really spend a good penny and get a really, really good one, more often than not, they're the type of thing that is sitting in someone's garage unused. So, anyway, that's my sewing machine seminar.

[00:09:57] Bob: Thank you. So looking at... Uh, just to go down this tangent a little bit further, looking at these machines, like the one that I sent you, David, it's, you know, it's got a big table, like a big metal table that's part of the thing. You get the whole thing at a time. Yeah. And, while I'm looking at that thinking, I would love to have a sewing machine, but I would not have a place to put that table.

That's my first thought. Which, yeah, which got me thinking about something I've been thinking about recently, about resetting my entire shop. And I'm not sure that I'm going to do this, but it might be interesting to get some feedback from you guys. At our office, we've got a couple of lasers. I've got the big 5x10 CNC.

And I don't use those things because they're there. And so I've thought about bringing one of the lasers home, the Thunder. And maybe bring the CNC home, but to bring it home, I would have to cut it down probably. Cause it's just, that's way too big to have in your basement. And in doing that and looking at the shop and trying to figure out, you know, where would those things go?

How could I reconfigure? It's like, I can, I can make it work. I can push things around and you know, things go into corners and I have to pull stuff out when I use it. But then that got me thinking about like, I've been in this shop longer than I was in my last shop. And. So it's been enough time that I've accumulated a lot of new tools.

My interests have changed a lot. I still have things that I've used, but not that often. I've built furniture for tools that just is still there, but I don't necessarily, you know. And so it got me looking at the entire space, which is a good sized space, and thinking, What if I just started over? What if I legitimately went from one side to the other and...

Stickers on stuff like keep, sell, keep, sell, keep, sell, just go through the whole thing. Not necessarily to minimize, but to optimize, but to, you know, to make it more flexible. And maybe less of a wood shop and more of just a shop shop. Different things, maybe I split it into a clean room, maybe, I don't know, like, I just started thinking about that.

Have you all ever considered doing anything like, I know Jimmy would just like get another building, so that's not really an issue for him. But, have you ever considered that? Just like, resetting completely? 

[00:12:10] David: Not to that extreme, no. 

[00:12:12] Jimmy: I have, but it's just too daunting of a task to even think it through. 

[00:12:17] David: I'm redoing some pieces of shop furniture.

Just because after a couple years, like, you realize, Oh, this could be a little bit more efficient. This bottom needs to be open so I can hide stuff and pull stuff in and out. And, this is where I need a drawer, this is where I need a cabinet. Uh, so I've slowly redone some of that. But as far as my shop is, it's pretty darn efficient, I would say.

And the tools are, for the most part, besides a couple of them, are where they need to be, and it works for me. So I have no desire of doing a complete reset until someday we can actually expand the shop. And I think I would do the exact same setup, I would just spread things out a little bit more. So I could get a full sheet of plywood onto the table.

Right now that plywood hits the back, the tools on the back wall, which are a bunch of sanders. Yeah. I've, I think I've just slowly optimized over the last 10 years. 

[00:13:18] Bob: Well, and when you laid out your shop in the first place, you spent a lot of time. Yeah. And it wasn't haphazard. It was, yeah. Yeah. I, 

[00:13:27] David: I had. And I kind of nerd out about this stuff where I draw everything up in Illustrator, a top down view.

I print it out and then I cut everything out of paper and play with arrangements and see what is what is going to work. 

[00:13:44] Bob: I'm doing that for our basement right now because I'm thinking about taking this room on the other side of my office that's like just a basement room and it's been a bunch of different things so far since we've lived here, but it needs to be A big just hangout room for my kids.

They're getting older. They need more space. They need to have friends over and stuff. And so I'm doing that right now in Fusion where I kind of just drew the floor plan and I'm drawing a few pieces. I thought about doing the same thing for the shop, but when I look at the number of things I would have to draw for the shop, it's like, nope.

Yeah, it's not even worthwhile. So I'm just gonna kind of eyeball it, I think. Sounds like you got a set of things. I don't know, so, if you, if you are not, if your shop is efficient, but maybe not as big, where it's like... You know, you don't have as many opportunities. What would you do with a sewing machine like this, if you were to get one, where would you put it?

Put 

[00:14:37] Jimmy: it on wheels, and it becomes one of those things that has everything piled on it until you need it. I know, because I have like eight of them. 

[00:14:46] Bob: But it's also something that could live inside, it doesn't necessarily need to be in your shop, because it, I mean, I assume you would want to protect a machine like that from sawdust and...

[00:14:54] Jimmy: Oh, well, yeah, well, you just, you know... Soil dust does build up on them, and I usually just throw a cloak over them, any kind of drape. It is, they're heavy, so if you, they're difficult to move around, they usually have rubber feet, and they're very heavy, so I often put them on wheels. I have my two, my two weavers, which is the 205, which is for sewing through like one inch thick of leather hide.

It's a giant, strong machine. One inch thick? It'll go through one inch thick of leather hide, yeah, it's an unbelievable machine. Do cows have skin that thick? Well if you do several layers, like on a, Well, for instance, here, let me show you this. I have this sitting on my table. This is a knife sheath. And since 

[00:15:31] Bob: we're doing video...

That's a, that's a mean cow. 

[00:15:33] Jimmy: You can't... So, look at this thickness of leather. Oh my goodness. That's about, that's about a half inch. It's three layers of ten ounce. And that's just sewn right on the machine. Just right through. Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop. It looks like it's hand stitched. At least the top stitch looks hand stitched.

The bottom doesn't look as hand stitched. These are really, this is a type of machine that's, it's extremely useful. In a minute I'll grab a wallet that I made. So I have that machine which is very heavy to move around. It's got hard rubber feet that you grab the ground. It's like velcroed to the ground.

And same with the 303. But I do have a couple of Juki's in the bigger shop that I have on wheels that I move around. And occasionally I do use those. But now I'm addicted to the two Weaver machines I have because I'm just so used to them now. They both have walking foots which is very convenient to have for any machine.

And I've always put them on dollies. So what I'll do is I'll buy a dolly. from Harbor Freight. I cut it in half, and then I extend it so it's just as long left to right in the wide direction, is that would be the Y Axis and that's the X Axis. in the X Axis, I make it longer by just cutting it right in half and then using the tabs on each side to screw to a two by four.

And then I make my Poptive sewing machine on that. So you can move it around the 

[00:16:51] David: So my brain capacity, it's filled. It won't accept any more information. And there are certain tools that I have to watch a video or read instructions. It's mostly watch a video to relearn how to do every single time. And one of them is my box joint making jig, the Inkra one.

It just doesn't make sense to me when I pull it out. I have to, I have to watch it. 

[00:17:14] Jimmy: Yeah. I feel like that. Get a little tiny piece of wood. I know. Yep. It's so much 

[00:17:18] David: easier to make. Yeah, you can make a box joint jig much faster than you can watch a video on 

[00:17:23] Jimmy: it. I made one on my crosscut slide, it took me 8 seconds.

Yeah. No adjustment, it worked perfect. 

[00:17:27] David: It's actually, that, the video on making your own is one of my most popular videos on my channel. So... When I look at these sewing machines, you have parts, a bobbin, is that a name of one of the things? You have, you have thread coming from multiple angles. It looks like I would have to relearn how to use it every single time.

[00:17:50] Jimmy: No, well, use it enough times in the beginning and then you start to figure it 

[00:17:54] David: out. That's the problem. I would use it and then I wouldn't use it again for six months. 

[00:17:59] Jimmy: No, it's not that bad. It's not that bad. In fact, you do have to pay close attention. A friend of mine the other day said, I'm having so much trouble with my sewing machine and I happen to be in the town where she lives.

So I stopped over. I said, well, I'll come by tonight. I'm going to be there. So I went over and I looked and she said, this machine is, it doesn't work. I can't believe it's been driving me crazy. And it's one of those little machines that gets closed up in a plastic box, which are very dainty and they're really.

X Carve, X Tool, X Machine, X Carve Pro, X Tool, X Machine, X Carve, X Tool, X Carve, X Machine, Most likely because you have it threaded wrong. It just kept ball. The, the machines that once they're threaded correctly, they're almost infallible, but if they're not threaded correctly, it'll make, you never want to touch a sewing machine again.

Hmm. And usually since we have all Google, you could just Google the configuration of the way it gets threaded. It's easy when you think about, I did run into that on, on my, so, so many people that use Weaver, 

[00:19:09] Bob: these machines. My weaver crank machine. Yeah. I did run into that one time where it's, I ran outta thread or something happened and I had to like rethread it.

And I did it wrong, and it just did not work, and then I went back and watched a second video, and took everything off, and did everything again, and then it worked great! But it made me scared for the next time it runs out of thread, or whatever the situation was, I don't remember now. I was just like, man, I don't want to have to, like, re do this every time.

Yeah. Or, you make a video about it, you post it on your own channel, and 

[00:19:39] David: then... I have done that so many times. When I go to make a pen on the lathe, I have to watch my own video on how to make a pen on the lathe.

[00:19:50] Jimmy: I forget what it was, something that I had made in the past. And I was thinking about doing it again, and I was like, I don't even know where to begin. I was like, well, let me just go look at my own video. And I, I forgot, I didn't, I forgot what it was, but it was just an impulse I had. I was like, I want to make one of those.

And I'm like, oh wait, you already did one of those. How did you do it? I can't remember. 

[00:20:07] David: The title of one of our episodes from a couple weeks ago just hits home so hard. And it's something along the lines of every video is a, is a career. 

[00:20:19] Jimmy: That's what Aaron would always say to me. He said, every one of your videos is somebody's whole career.

That's what Aaron used to say to me.

Don't be afraid to get a sewing machine. It really will change your life. And that being said, what am I up to? I've been making these leather bags and I just did a bunch of stories last night on these leather bags that I'm making and I've sold a few of them already and I would hopefully sell more.

Sewing is difficult and I'm, and I'm okay at it. I'm not perfect, but I'm pretty okay at it. And when a lot of people see the bags I make, they're like, I want one, I want one, I want one. And I'm just, talk about design, last week's episode. Set up some criteria for myself, how to be able to make a bag that was repeatable, how to go together strongly, and how to eliminate stitches.

And years before, I came up with this link and lock system where the tab plugs into another hole, so the leather comes up, it's kind of like a Chinese food box, where it comes up and locks to itself on the side. I came up with what I believe is a successful design for that. I eliminated sewing because I want them to always look the same and because I'm just, I'm not that good at sewing.

Not to mention this leather is eight, ten ounce leather. It's super strong leather and it would be difficult to sew it right every single time. Even in the configuration that I made it, it would be I wouldn't even know how to sew it, so I had to make it the way I made it, where it's tabbed and slotted together with a couple of rivets to keep it together forever.

And with all my sewing experience, I was like, I want to make a production bag that has no sewing in it whatsoever. Because that was the hang up for me, to try and do something cleanly and perfectly the same every time. I knew the sewing would be the hindrance. I can make a one off, and this week I'm going to make a leather...

Roll bag or a saddle bag for a bicycle that clips underneath the bicycle seat. It's going to be a weaver leather video and there'll be a little bit of sewing in that but not a lot. The sewing will really be more visual accents as opposed to actual doing sewing job. I'm going to do it more just because it looks good around the edges so I could eliminate it entirely which I might.

But sewing when it comes to the zipper bags that I made is obviously essential. You couldn't make those without Sewing, you have to sew a zipper to the end of a fabric, and uh, when it comes to concealing where the ends of the stitch goes and how to hide it, that's, that's always been my hang up. And that's primarily because I never worked in a factory situation.

I'll give you a situation where Taylor always handmade stuff, always, always still hand makes stuff, Taylor, my ex, and this year she got a job at a small factory making custom made clothes. It's the first time she had to make stuff for somebody else. And her sewing skills greatly improved because there was no getting out of it.

You had to figure out, you had to look at the other sewer, ask the supervisor, how do I close this? What's the best way? And she said her sewing skills have improved 15 times because working in a situation with... It's like being a musician and just always playing alone. When you play with other musicians, you get better because you pick up tips and tricks.

And sewing is the same thing. If you sew alone constantly and you try and... Figure out things online and pictures and stuff. You can only probably get so far until you actually sit with a really experienced somebody who's worked in a factory situation or worked for a tailor and was, was given and handed down skills.

So if you really get interested in sewing, it's really important to go work with somebody. That's not gonna let you get away with. I always consider the sewing jobs I do prototypes. Obviously, they work well for whatever if it's a one off, but if I ever had to do them over and over again. Like my, my zipper bag, the one that has, it's made out of fabric with a liner.

The liner isn't resolved. You know, it's funny because Taylor Sarton's right away. She's like, this doesn't do this. You gotta, I'm like, I'm making one. I'm not making ten. There's a lot of unresolved issues inside where the open But for me, that's how I can do it. I never worked with somebody that could teach me how to make a liner that conceals all the construction.

[00:24:24] David: When somebody points out a mistake on one of my projects, I'll just say, oh, this is a prototype. 

[00:24:29] Jimmy: Of course, that's what you say. I'm experimenting. 

[00:24:31] Bob: Yeah. What do you do? I think what you were saying about like, you know, getting that kind of hands on or next to somebody experience, I think that's the case with anything, honestly.

I was talking to Bernie Solow. Last weekend when I was at the LBEX, uh, the Lightburn thing, and we were talking about, uh, welding. He's taken welding classes, and he's taken a bunch of machining classes, and all this type of stuff, and he was just telling me about the difference. in, uh, the figuring it out knowledge versus the instruction knowledge and the sitting next to somebody knowledge and how that's affected him and what he's learned from it and stuff and offered to come down and like spend a day with me on the, uh, the Bridgeport and on the South Bend and just kind of walk me through it, which is great because those things are, are like without hands on experience.

I'm really shooting in the dark, you know, because any project is not like a standard project, uh, and when it comes to machining, like every one is some unique setup. Yeah, 

[00:25:35] Jimmy: that's, that's why machinists love machining because it's, everything's like a puzzle to solve and they love showing it off to other machines.

And that's, I mean, I mean that. In a loving way, I love seeing machinists show off their skills and tricks that they've thought of and the inventive ways they solve problems. Sewing is similar in that way, where it's like, how do you hide this and how do you hide that? By the way, I talked about her in the past, Agatha Blois is a woman who, in 1999, we rented the second floor of, I had a two story shop in the city, we rented the second story office to her.

If she needed a place to sew, we met through friends, and she makes clothes for rock and roll stars. Like, when you see, like, when you see Britney Spears in, you know, in the early aughts walking around in, like, tight, leathery clothes, Agatha made those clothes in my shop. When you see like, uh, uh, Rob Halford walking around in this big long Hellraiser coat, she made that coat.

I mean, she was unbelievable. She is, she lives in LA now, she's an unbelievable artist. Leatherworker. She makes the most insane clothes for rock stars. She's the one who got me sewing. She's the one who sat with me and showed me tricks and tips to get me started. And I had a sewing machine sitting in the shop.

I never touched it. I just did a couple of straight stitches. She was the one who showed me how to make a pattern and I'm not great at it, but she got me really started. And got me looking at that machine where I could see it as a potential for making projects as opposed to something that intimidates me.

She got me past that hump, which is obviously the hump we all need to get over no matter what the machine is, whether it's a CNC machine or a laser cutter or whatever.

So, uh, what else am I doing? I did the, I did the bags this week, which are up for sale. They're on my Instagram page, mostly. And the, uh, we made some milestones on the graveyard house. Me and Mike were able to put in half of the sill plate. Which is underneath that big suspended open roof, which you see on my stories from time to time.

And maybe after today's podcast we'll put the next three pieces in, which will be the full complete circumference, and then I can start putting the walls up, which are going to support. And in the meantime, the sill plate is suspended in space by a couple of stilts, and my stonemason is filling up the undergap.

with StackStone. So it's, it's, we're putting it back the way it was, but better. And that's gonna probably be in a new video. Probably in a couple weeks. I just started editing up my episode 5 last night. 5 or 6? I can't remember. 

[00:28:07] Bob: Cool. The house video's doing well? 

[00:28:10] Jimmy: Nothing's doing well. But I don't care anymore.

Cool. Cool. I made a brass, I made a bronze door knocker. It's got 60, 000 views. It's just like, whatever. Now I'm just playing to my mom and my family. And those 60, 000 people. You know, 

[00:28:27] Bob: those close friends of mine. That's a big family if you 

[00:28:29] Jimmy: have 60, 000 people in your family. No, everything hits 100, 000.

Occasionally hear like the sounds of brakes screeching in like the distance and I'm like, what is that? I'm like, oh, that was my video. It just stopped getting views. 

[00:28:42] Bob: It just hit a wall and is now dead. Yeah. Yeah. Well, let's see, for me, um, I've been working on, uh, uh, a new Lego sorter. So, I, a while back I made a Lego sorter that was like a funnel kind of thing, like a tower with different plates in it with different size holes in it.

And you pour them in the top and they would filter through and then, you know, kind of land on a different level that where they would stop filtering and then you could, you could dump them. And it actually worked really well. Um, But it was small, it was only about this big around, so it couldn't hold a whole lot of bricks, and I also made it to mount on the side of my kid's Lego table that I built for them.

So you could scoop them off the edge of the table into this thing and they would sift down and go. And it worked pretty well, but I was wanting something that would be... Like, on the table, a tabletop, movable kind of version, something that could hold more bricks and have just a more repeatable design, because I was thinking, like, this is something I think other people could use.

Pete Squared made a really good sorter. Several years ago, I think now. Did they stack square boxes? Yeah, it's these, these filter boxes that are stacked up on wheels or on casters. So you pour a bunch of stuff in the top and then you just like shake it around on a table or on the floor or whatever. I mean, it's pretty big, so usually on the floor.

And it filters down into these trays and then you, you unstack the trays and dump them. It's a really cool idea. I ran across a video, what got me thinking about this was I ran across a video of some Lego Person who like a content creator, who's like a Lego person. And they bought one of his sorters a couple of years ago.

And we're kind of doing an unboxing and a, you know, showing it off to their Lego people. And I'm like, Oh, that's pretty wild. I hadn't seen it from the Lego. YouTube side. I had seen it from the woodworker YouTube side or Instagram or wherever it was. And it was really funny just seeing something from kind of our community in another community being used as a tool rather than as.

It's a product, you know, like we, it was, I don't know, but it got me thinking about, oh, like I've been wanting to do my version of that thing again. And so I started doing that and it's this interesting combination of, um, 3d printing and laser work. And so it's not a whole lot of building. But it was a whole lot of problem solving, getting the thing to fit together.

And basically it's a bin that's on a stand, excuse me. It's on a stand that sits on a table. And so you dump stuff in the top and then you slide in a filter on the top and then you spin it over and it's like a rotisserie. So you can spin it over and it filters everything out down into a little tray.

Then you flip it back up, pull out the filter, put it in a different size filter. Like a bingo roll? Yeah, kind of. Yeah. But one side of it has a filter hole, like, panel in it, and so that panel is swappable. So you filter it out, then you go to a smaller filter, or actually a bigger filter, then you do it again, and so getting all of the pieces to fit together.

But then have enough tolerance for these like pieces of acrylic to slide through but not slide too much because you want them to be tight and there's a lot of problem solving that I'm not sure how much of it's actually going to make it into the video but it was it was actually a lot of fun to figure out how to make.

So that's coming out this weekend and you know I don't it's one of those that I was really excited about I had a great time doing but probably not going to do super well. but 

[00:32:25] David: you never know. What about a color, color 

[00:32:27] Bob: sorter? Color sorter, that's a whole like, yeah, that's a, that's a Raspberry Pi machine learning, yeah, imaging thing.

That's like, uh, Shane from Stuff Made Here should make that. He would be good at that. 

[00:32:44] David: I used to work on websites for a company that made, uh, the camera eyes that factories would use to Kick out defective products, like they made cameras for Ball, uh, Ball as in the canning company, and they make like Coke cans and Pepsi cans.

And these, these camera eyes, they work within a fraction of a second. We'll just see thousands of these aluminum cans and just kick off the bad ones off the belt. It's just, it's fascinating how fast they work. 

[00:33:19] Jimmy: This goes back to my recommendation, I'll tell you in a minute. 

[00:33:23] Bob: Um, along those lines of the, like, color sorter thing, though, there, there's actually an app, it may be an official Lego app, I think, um, that you can lay out a bunch of bricks that you have on a flat surface, and then you take a picture of it, and it will figure out what you have, and then create or find simple models, and give you instructions that you, so like, you could build this with the bricks that you have.

That's wild. That's incredible. Isn't that wild? Yeah. And it's just, you know, made for kids, so you can, like, just take a picture with your tablet. 

[00:33:55] Jimmy: Whoa. That's mind blowing.

[00:34:01] Bob: So that, that, like, sorting, or the finding, I guess, part of that sorting mechanism. It's there. It's already done. Uh, next would be, you know, some sort of pick and place kind of robot that could just go like, Beep, beep, beep, beep, and put it all the places it needed to be. That's not my specialty, so I'm not going to do that.

Wow. Anyway, so I'm making a sorter, uh, uh, kind of brute force, you know, manual sorter, and uh, it was, it was a fun thing, so we'll see how it turns out, but, and then I also, uh, last weekend maybe? Yeah, Sunday, I went out to the farm for the first time in, I don't even know how long, and spent like three hours, Sunday afternoon, just working on the Ghia with no camera, with no headphones in.

I opened the door and let fall just blow into the barn and it was so beautiful and it was, it was perfect. It was a couple hours of. Body filler and sanding, body filler and sanding. And then, you know, it was, man, it was so good. But the thing that was really interesting about that, other than just it being nice, was that I put in like maybe three hours.

It couldn't have been more. But when I stood back from, and I was working on, you know, kind of like up close right here, a lot of like looking up close at the sanding to see how well it was sanded and stuff. And then at the end of the three hours, I backed up. And I had made visible, measurable progress around this entire car.

It was like, you know, I mean, the section was maybe this big and then a couple of little sections. But I stood back and was like, Oh, those things are done. They're ready for primer, like done, done, done. And it made me think like, this actually might be possible. Like the bodywork, maybe something that I can eventually 

[00:35:59] Jimmy: actually...

Three years in. Like, maybe you could actually do this. 

[00:36:03] Bob: Yeah. Cause I think, you know, there's a certain level of just like, I mean, this is probably never gonna actually get finished, but I'm gonna keep working on it, just to make a little progress. But, I, 

[00:36:13] Jimmy: you know. Come on Bob, see the ending, hang up a couple of pictures and finish Cars R Out.

[00:36:18] Bob: I can see it, but you know, like, you kind of forget, like, when you have all of that work on something, you kind of forget that the end goal is something that you're actually trying to get to, it's not just the next step. Yeah, there's 

[00:36:29] Jimmy: too much fog ahead in front of you. 

[00:36:32] Bob: And so, seeing a couple of little things that...

At the beginning of the day were messed up, and at the end of the day they were fixed. Cool, okay, and it got me really motivated to, you know, if I spent maybe five or six more of those days at three or four hours at a time, the bodywork could be done. Like, this thing could be ready for paint, and that's, that's pretty wild to think that that's a possibility.

So, anyway, um, yeah, I'm gonna try to schedule some of those days, you know, so that I can just keep, keep I'm chewing at it a little bit. How do you 

[00:37:09] Jimmy: eat an elephant? 

[00:37:11] Bob: So it's funny you said that because as I was , as I was doing that work and I stood back and I looked at it, I was like, how do I make a video about eating an elephant?

This about this feeling of little bits of work. 'cause I mean, our videos, they have to be, they have to be a story. They have to be a, here's the setup, here's the payoff. They have to be something that draws people in and. In some way, so like, how do you make a video about doing a little bit of work a bunch of times?

And that was what came to mind, is how do you eat an elephant? So I was like, okay, if I start with that idea, how do you eat an elephant as the video? How do I make a video about that with the car as the example? And so for three days since then. It's really funny that you said that because that has been in my head going how do I turn that phrase into a video and how do I make it not just like a thing you say at the beginning and a thing you say at the end but how do I actually stretch that into a story and do the work at the same 

[00:38:10] David: time?

I, if I may interrupt just for a second, I just went through that. Uh, a few days ago, I wanted to make a tour of the new house so I can kind of kick off the start of this journey. And I was like, I can't just do a walk in the door, go through a tour. It has to be a story. And so I spent a good, a day plus, just figuring out how to turn it into a story.

Have like a, a middle... Uh, or beginning. You start with the beginning. You always start with the beginning, middle, and end. And so the tour is only one part of it. Then there's the, then there's the why. And then there's the, the how. And I, I really put a lot of thought into what's going to be probably just a 10 minute video, but it was just like, I'm scripting.

I don't normally script. Not word for word, but I'm scripting of how I'm going to approach this. And, um, it's just, it's one of those things like maybe if this works out, if I can figure out the, uh, good packaging for it, maybe I need to kind of script my videos a little bit more. I don't know, but it was a lot of 

[00:39:19] Bob: work.

Yeah, yeah, but it's interesting because, I mean, we've gone back and forth on different amounts of that pre production stuff over the years. Like, we've tried to really figure everything out ahead of time. We've obviously tried to not figure out anything at a time and just go for it. And there is some floating place in between those that is really productive where you put in a lot of work up front and it makes the rest of it so much easier and you kind of know where you're headed and you know what the edit is supposed to accomplish and stuff like that.

It's hard to. to do that every time. For me, anyway, it's hard to think through that stuff every 

[00:39:54] David: time. I, I feel like if I am just talking to the camera off the cuff, I feel like that's a little bit more real. But, and then when, when I script her or when I have an outline, it doesn't feel as real to me, but the information is more condensed and it's concise and it's more valuable.

So it's, it's, it's, I just have to learn how to talk to a camera that's That feels authentic to me, but it's still a little bit structured. 

[00:40:26] Bob: Yeah, yeah, that is something to get used to. Ten years later, I'm still figuring this out. Oh, yeah, I mean, it's not like... Well, it keeps changing. Yeah. I mean, that's part of it.

And we keep changing. Yeah. And, you know, that's a bunch of variables that we constantly have to juggle. Um, so, speaking of the house, we had an idea for kind of a topic today. Because you have all of this opportunity, so what was the thing that you wanted to kind of... Brainstorm 

[00:40:56] David: about this kind of goes back to your talk about the shop as well is what do you do with a blank slate?

If you, so I have a, I have a bedroom. I have two bedrooms and I have a living room and each one is just an open space. How do you approach designing for that space? Where do you start? Have you ever started with a blank slate? Because a lot of times, all of us, we, we, we have these homes that we already live in.

It's already occupied by furniture and then we're just adding to and taking away. 

[00:41:31] Bob: The only time I've started with a blank slate is in my current shop because it was like I had this much stuff and I had this much room and I got to decide how to spread a small amount of, relatively small amount of stuff into a big space, you know, and then that empty space is filled up over the years, but that's not really the same as like a, or maybe it is, I don't know.

It's not really the same as a bedroom or a living room, you know, like a living space, I guess. I mean, my approach to any of those things. Is always gonna start with the functional, you know, and then like the design and the aesthetic of the whole thing is gonna be the last thing that I try to cram on top of the functional thing just because of how I am.

I would immediately look at a space and like, all right, make a list of what does it have to accomplish? What are the, what are the necessities? What are the things that it needs to do? And what pieces of furniture do I have that I have to put somewhere? And is there a way to make them, you know, I would do the constraint stuff first and then add on top of that.

That's just me. 

[00:42:39] Jimmy: I always get intimidated. I did this room over last year. The whole room gutted and re sheetrocked and insulated and painted and it's still temporarily arranged because I just, I have such a hard time. I got my desk and everything I need. I got like five stools around me so that I could have all this extra stuff around me.

There's like a stool right here. There's one right there. I got this pull out drawers. I'm horrible at it. I really am. I need somebody in my life that comes in and just organizes stuff. I have all my pictures that were hanging on my previous arrangement in here, all just leaning on the wall waiting for me to hang them up.

[00:43:15] Bob: If somebody else organizes something for you... That would be great. Does it feel organized to you though? Yes Yeah, well, I mean, that's not a jab. That's a legitimate question because like if somebody else organizes stuff for me I don't necessarily know where it is. There was a 

[00:43:31] Jimmy: time in my life. I'm old. I'm much older than you guys 

[00:43:34] Bob: There 

[00:43:36] Jimmy: was a time in my life Where I was very, very OCD about, nobody touched my stuff.

And then over the last, I don't know, maybe it has to do with having assistants. I don't know, I've had Dave, I used to have Keith, was before everybody knew me. And then, uh, Dave, and that's when everyone got to know me on YouTube. And then, uh, Aaron, Brett, Rob. And, uh, Aaron started taking over, and I've talked about this before.

Aaron would, he, as he got to know me, and he became a little bit more... Free thinking without worrying about what I thought. I'd come in and go, I hope you don't mind I rearranged this whole wall, and I was just like, Oh my god, that looks amazing. And then I'd like have at it. And then I'd come into work and he'd be like, I hope you don't mind, I took Sunday and I rearranged this whole corner of the shop.

I think it works much better. Oh my god. 

[00:44:36] David: I think there's things that you will never think of. Yeah, when somebody else does something 

[00:44:40] Jimmy: for you, you, I was never really good at it. Like, I didn't want anybody touching my stuff, but not because I just, it was really because it was so messy and I knew where everything was because nothing had a place.

Like, if I put my watch right here beside my computer on pile, if I can turn my camera, there's a pile of five very expensive watches just sitting on top of one another. Like, if anybody saw these watches, they would take them away from me and be like, you don't deserve to own these expensive watches. And I just don't want anybody touching them because I know that's where I left them.

They're fine there. Don't touch them. Versus somebody coming in and going, Oh, you know what you need? This would be nice if they were in a drawer with like a velvet lining. I'm like, Oh, that's a great idea. Could you make that for me? That would be awesome. So I need somebody like that in my life. Somebody that, I mean, Rob is good.

Rob does more industrial technical stuff, but when it comes to just arranging things, I, I don't. I, I, I miss that. That's all I'm saying. I miss, of course, I miss Aaron. But, the, um, he was the first person in my life that, like, took complete charge. Without waiting for me to be like, okay, let's organize this shelf.

He, like, just took him, he's like, you know what, the way you had it was obviously just random. I took time to put it in color order, in size order, in chemical order. Whatever it was. He sorted through a box of bolts that I had, and then put them in every drawer. He's like, this just seems to work better, I hope you don't mind.

I'm like... No, that's awesome. Like, if you saw my stories yesterday, I bought the Milwaukee little snap lit box for the Dremel tools that I recently bought. I bought the one that I didn't like, and then I bought a Milwaukee version. And I want to put them in a case, so I know, like, that case has all my... I could just grab and go with that, and I can go to a job site if I needed to, or go to a different part of my, my kingdom and fix something over there in a different domain.

And having the box with all the stuff in it. And so, I tried to get a little snap... It's an infiniteibrary array of various components and other stuff we're excavating right now out here in Chicago. So, 약간 여기 보시면 찾아 보이시겠지만 바자 många 같은 날치 글래버입니다. It's an infiniteibrary array of various components and other stuff we're excavating right now out here in Chicago.

That's my organization. Can 

[00:47:01] David: I, I have a little gripe. And it drives me bonkers. Any, any box. I have Dewalt ones. I think Milwaukee makes a similar one. Any kind of box that is meant to separate nuts and bolts and washers and all of that. They have the little dividers so you can make the spaces that you want.

Eventually, those little dividers they start to pull up and then all they mix underneath. And then even when you buy a full set of like machine screws with the different sizes and everything, they come in these little cases and those little dividers, they pull up and they all get mixed together. 

[00:47:37] Jimmy: That's why I just mix them together when I get them.

[00:47:41] David: And I know I could take a little bit of CA glue and just lock them in place, but. 

[00:47:46] Bob: Yeah, but you have to take everything out to do that. 

[00:47:48] Jimmy: I will say this. I'm not, this isn't a commercial for Milwaukee because everybody knows how much I loathe all tool companies, but Milwaukee makes this pack out system where if you do have a cup full of screws, it is completely in its own cup, which fits into a tray.

And then when you close the lid, the lid actually pops into the cup so you can flip it in any direction. Nothing gets mixed. In fact, it's a little annoying because if your cups are overfilled, the lid won't close. You always need to leave a little bit of air space at the top of any one of these cups. And so I've been really kind of getting into that system.

I actually enjoy it. And that's why I thought it would be good to have one of these little small snap lids and have at least one or two boxes in there. But the cutting tools don't fit in that box. So I was like, you know what, let me take these cups out. I'll use them somewhere else in my... Milwaukee Packout System.

And I'll just use this whole entire empty case for everything. You 

[00:48:40] David: just inspired me to quickly design maybe like a little 2 inch by 2 inch square cup rounded rounded edges so the nuts and bolts don't get to the side and a little pull handle right in the middle of it so I could pull it out and take it to the bench.

Oh, that's a nice idea. And I should just have my 3D printers just running all day making those things. 

[00:49:03] Jimmy: Yeah, how about if we talked about possibly brainstorming this room up, wouldn't it be cool if you had, inspired by the packout system or any type of tool system where you organize stuff, imagine a whole room like that.

Now, I don't know what that means exactly, but the bed or the day bed, whatever, looks just like it's made out of plastic and it can be like modulated. The pillows all fit together, but they could fit somewhere else too. I don't know. I'm just brainstorming. The table, the stools, everything. You could put them in a corner of a room and it'll be like.

All blocked together, no empty air space, but you could pull them apart, and they could be individual parts, but you could push them all together, and they could become one thing. Like the stools and the seats can all come together and become a bigger table. Yeah. I don't know. I've seen stuff like that where you have, uh, you know, that's why I love the, the Apple crates, the movie Apple crates.

You ever see those things that they use on movies and TV shoots? The Apple, Apple boxes, not crates, Apple boxes. I love those because you can put four together and make a little stage, you can put four together in the second position and then it's a stage but it's higher, it's a little smaller, and you could, I constantly sit on them, so I'm always looking around the shop to grab one to sit on, like last night I welded something, and I was like, I can get the rolling chair with the cushion, I'm like, I'd rather sit on the apple box, happens to be something nice about it, where I can kind of move around and it's not going to move.

It's not going to roll. But if you set up a room with modular furniture, I don't know, what does that look like? 

[00:50:36] Bob: What is the intent? Let's go back to the room, like what is, you have a bedroom, let's take one of the bedrooms, is it just a bedroom? Is there any requirement? Do there any things that have to be there?

[00:50:48] David: There needs to be this cohesive feel between all the pieces. When Jimmy talks about like modular furniture, one of the beautiful things about modular furniture is they all look like it belongs. They all are, uh, it's a, it's a set. It looks together. So I am not just making a bed and some nightstands. I am making, uh, a set.

Concept. Like you would go to Williams Sonoma and you would buy a full.

And so I'm trying to work like that and even the artwork on the wall and the, the, the color of the walls, the paneling that we're going to choose, I want there to be a feel for each room. And this is not something I've done because everything has been so individual and sometimes like, Oh, well there's a, there's the Pachudo style, which is basically Danish modern mid century modern stuff.

And but each piece has always been individual. Now it's like, it's trying to create this flow and this is going to all tie into my pick of the week. 

[00:51:50] Bob: So you, you talking about it that way makes me think that maybe a good way to make those things individual but cohesive is just to start to dissect, you know, maybe you have a table or something that you've already made that you're like, this is the.

This is the thing, this is the aesthetic, this is the direction I want all of those pieces to inherit. So, dissect that piece. I used this kind of curve. All the curves need to be a variation of this. I used this thickness of tabletop. All of the surfaces need to be this. You know, start to... Break down some, like, requirements, then when you go to design a bedside table, it doesn't have to stand alone, or it can stand alone, but you also have a set of criteria that you're like, well, okay, I'm going to design this thing, but it's going to have this thickness, it's going to have this curve, it's going to have this, like, whatever, taper.

Um, and so, you know, you could dissect something that you like to build some criteria, design criteria for 

[00:52:48] David: other stuff. I haven't actually thought, I've been collecting, I've been into mood boards lately of just collecting ideas. And, and I've been doing that, and I've been like, circling, like, I like the way this looks on this particular piece, but I have not set a list of criteria, like, that, that thickness, or that curve, and that is definitely something I need to do, 

[00:53:12] Bob: for sure.

So when I, when I model something in Fusion, and I know this is different, but there's a crossover, when I think about, I'm gonna model... This bottle, this, this is a juice bottle from a local place. So if I'm going to model this bottle, I start to look at all of the things that I could turn into parameters.

The width of the bottle, the radius on the bottom, how thick is the cap, all of those detail things. And I write all of them down and with the measurement. And then before I start actually drawing anything, I'll go in and fill out the parameters with all of those things named correctly. Then when I go to build it.

I just used the names of the thickness and, you know, bottom radius and whatever. And so I think if you took that same approach to define the things that are unique about that particular object, and maybe you don't have to go that far because you're talking about a style, not a particular object, but I think the same thing applies.

You write down the things that are important, the things that make that unique, the things that you would want to recreate. You make a list of them and then you use them to inform a new design. So I think you could do that like from the aesthetic standpoint or from like a construction, you know, like maybe you're thinking about, I don't know, joinery.

You could do it the same way. It may not be visible stuff, but it would at least make consistent across multiple pieces yeah 

[00:54:32] David: well especially if you're doing joinery you maybe you have to create a custom jig for one piece but that custom jig now is usable for all the pieces within that particular room sure you know 

[00:54:43] Bob: that's so you have two bedrooms and what was the other one living room living room and a 

[00:54:48] David: tiny little office yeah 

[00:54:51] Bob: So the living room is, so the bedrooms, I would imagine you could apply like, you're probably not going to do the exact same aesthetic between the two of them, right?

Two completely different bedrooms. This one and that one. The living room is the big shared crossover space that. That most people will be in. Yeah. 

[00:55:08] Jimmy: Is there gonna be a theme, Dave? Like, is there an overall theme for the House Clowns clown? 

[00:55:12] Bob: Is that what you said? Clowns. You're gonna have clowns 

[00:55:14] Jimmy: throughout the world.

Because I have a theme for my graveyard house, which I probably talked about publicly, but I'll tell you about it in ghosts. 

[00:55:18] David: Yeah. There is def There's definitely a theme. I haven't, I don't, I, I don't have a phrase or a word for it, but I know what it is in my head. It's the PTO theme right? Throughout the entire house.

Mm-Hmm. . There's that particular feel. It is supposed to be. It's not only a house that we're kind of designing as a, from a woodworker's perspective from the ground up, but it's also, it's a gallery of my work. Like the whole thing, it's like, I've never been invited to show my pieces at a gallery. So I'm making my own.

And this is, this is what it, what it is. So it's, I want each room to have this cohesive feel to it, but I also want each piece to have a, an element of that's a little bit different, or that's really cool, or that's well designed type feel. 

[00:56:13] Jimmy: Hmm. Nice. Like a fit and finishing care to everything. Yeah. Yeah. As opposed to my house, the theme, the overall theme is Junk Drawer,

or Pre Hoarder, Pre Hoarder. That's, that's what the era of my house is, Junk Drawer, Pre Hoarder. My house actually isn't that bad, I'm just kidding around. My office, we got used to Airbnb in the house ten years ago, and so... This office happened to be the place that we would screw the door shut. So everything would get thrown into this particular room and I'd screw the door shut.

So this room became the junk drawer for, it's like last minute. Any personal things got thrown in here and the door got screwed shut. Obviously we don't, I don't Airbnb the house anymore. But the um, this room is sort of my junk drawer but I really make an effort to keep it quelled. Many people who know me personally know my dad is a legitimate hoarder.

My dad literally turned into a hoarder in his old age. My dad's going to be 84 and we recently spent, and I don't think I did any stories on this, about a month ago me and my siblings who are here in New York, we went to my dad's house and hired a dumpster and threw away Probably 10 percent of what needs to get thrown away, and he gave away, we convinced him to give away a van he had, which was completely full of tools, he hasn't driven the thing in 10 years, so he gave the van away, so he's better, he's getting better, he's not one of these guys that sits near the dumpster crying, I need that, I need that, a little bit, but not nearly, like he gave away, I need that, He gave, he literally let us throw away 80 percent of what I expected him to not let us throw away.

So he was getting really good. He's getting better at letting go of stuff. We need to attack the inside of the house. But I always have that in my back. That's in my rear view mirror, like, I don't, I don't want that in my life. And that's partly, partly why, outwardly, I, I, with Rob, we've... Decided to just sell so many things.

Rob handles the, the Facebook market stuff, anything. I'm like, get rid of it. Get rid of it. Get rid of it. Cause for years I've taken it and when I moved up here, I took in so much free stuff from people just because it's cool or it's going to go in a recycling bin. I'm like, let me have it. And so now I'm, it's either restored and I'm selling it off.

I'm giving it away, a lot of things I just give away because nobody wants to buy it, because it's an odd thing. Anyway, uh, I'm really conscious to try not to let the house become a water house. That's a long winded way of saying that. And I really make an effort to get rid of stuff and put stuff outside and give it away, whatever.

So that's always my fear. But when it comes down to really making fine decisions... With this new house, talk about a blank slate, the graveyard house, I started collecting things for a look and a feel. So when I come across something, I put it in the barn, which is, it's associated with the property, and I say this, I don't know if I said this publicly, but I want the house to be mortuary chic.

I want interesting mortuary stuff. So mostly turn of the century mortuary stuff. So I bought a, I bought a embalming table from 1880s, and the table's made completely out of porcelain, which I've come to learn in the last few years, people say porcelain, porcelain, porcelain. I didn't really understand what that meant.

It's basically made out of a clay that gets fired very, very high, so porcelain is much stronger than your average ceramic. So it's a porcelain table, completely made out of porcelain, which makes it... It's probably six, five, six hundred pounds. Yeah. It's like if you took a clawfoot bathtub and like morphed it into a flat slab.

That's what this looks like. So I'm trying to find stuff in that era. Maybe I might find like a cool wheelchair. So the whole thing is going to kind of have this like. Morbid museum quality to it. That's really what I'm going for, for the house. I'm definitely going to have to make a lot of stuff outside of just making the house and the rooms and stuff.

So I've been collecting little bits and pieces of architectural stuff for that. So that is definitely the conscious effort that I'm going to put into that house. And because I'm not going to live there, there's certainly not going to be any, uh, I'm trying to think of the word, extensive, unnecessary stuff that I don't need.

Like here, there's things I need because I 

[01:00:23] David: live here. That's our approach. Over there. Watches. 

[01:00:26] Jimmy: Yeah, it's gonna be just what's necessary just to make it a house. If you, if a friend's coming like, oh go live at the graveyard house for the week, everything you need is there. There's just a couple of cute personal collections that I've gotten, you know, maybe a couple of human skulls, a couple of rest in pieces on the wall, that kind of stuff.

[01:00:43] David: Typical, typical mortuary chic. What am I going to do 

[01:00:46] Bob: with all these skulls? I guess I should put them in my other house. There's 

[01:00:49] David: something... Freeing about designing this other house. It doesn't matter. Like when I make something for our living room, it is something I have to look at every single day. It is something I have to use every day.

It is something I share with. My wife and my dogs and So there seems to be a lot of pressure on the stuff I make for this house I don't know why but that pressure isn't there on this other house Even though I'm trying to make sure everything is tied together 

[01:01:21] Bob: Well, because like you're not even making that for someone else to have to look at every day You're making it for someone to have to look at for a couple of days If it's a short term rental, or a rental of any kind, like, they don't have to live with it, they just have to be there, so it's...

As long as it doesn't look terrible, you're probably good. Well, that's cool. Um, I'm excited to see how you, how you solve that, how you tackle that. It feels like a lot of upfront work. Oh yeah, 

[01:01:51] David: like, uh, I would love to have everything designed... First for each room and then build, but I can't work like that. I, I, it would, I wouldn't be able to make it.

It's too daunting for me. So I'm going to start with, you know, uh, a piece for each room and then just build from there. And I wasn't necessarily looking for input or ideas. I just wanted to know if you guys have had this particular experience and how you approached it. And it sounds like Jimmy's going through the same thing with the graveyard house.

Junk 

[01:02:22] Jimmy: drawer. Junk drawer. Junk drawer approach. No, with the house, obviously, I want the house to feel like a museum from, like, the 1890s. It's kind of the feel that I want. That's what I want. That's the theme I want. I'm not going to really change the exterior of the house other than just to restore it back to good, sturdy, well insulated bones.

Last night, I, I, I got my, I got my building permit last night, even though I started. I went to the house the other day and there was a building permit application like floating around inside the house. The town building permit guy, Dave, nice guy, I'm on his good side, he likes me. Because we did all these projects here at the house with him.

And I thought I bought the house with a permit, but last night he cleared up, he said, no the permit that was on the house has expired, so you need to apply for a new one. So I did last night, everything seemed fine. And uh, he was, he, he, he. He grew up here and he thanked me for tackling the project and doing the house the right way.

So it was, it went well. I was a little nervous that when I saw the thing, like, we keep missing each other. He only works a couple of days a week, so he's never around. And so when I saw the application, there's like a packet with like 50 pages in it and says all the requirements for the county and town.

And when I saw that, Floating around inside. He opened the door to the house, threw it inside, and closed the door. And so when I saw it like on the floor blowing, I'm like, hmm, I don't remember bringing a thick packet of information pages here. And I picked it up and it says, Eastern Building Permit Application.

I was like, oh, I got it. I got it. I understand now. Have you 

[01:03:55] David: mentioned what you're going to do with the house when it's Done? Or is this just a project? 

[01:04:01] Jimmy: It's a project. Me and Howard have been talking about buying property up here for a really long time. I mean, since we actually got together. And when we finally found this, it's, it's a nice setting.

It's a beautiful setting. And I said, If we wanted to modify anything, it's already halfway there. It's already been gutted completely. I don't have to deal with plaster. I don't have to remove rooms. He, this gentleman before me, did everything. So it would seem like a perfect opportunity to get into it. And once it's done, I'll probably have it either as a, as a spillover, if I ever did an event, have people stay there.

And obviously you could Airbnb it. I could rent it for whomever. Uh, Howard could use it for his family. It's just going to be an extra house. And then if things get to a situation where we had with COVID, where people were buying houses up here for 200 percent of the asking price, you know, 50 percent of the asking price, 150 percent of the asking price, I should say, I could maybe cash out and be like, you know what, let's do it.

Yeah. I, I, but more than, more than anything right now the priority is just making, making things right there and then getting, and collecting, uh, collecting content. Is, 

[01:05:12] David: uh, will guests be allowed to touch the human skulls? 

[01:05:18] Jimmy: They'll all be under glass domes. Okay, okay. There'll be one on the door you're gonna have to use as a knob.

That's amazing. That is absolutely amazing. And there's gonna be like heads on pikes all around the outside so you know when you walk. Wow. 

[01:05:34] Bob: You're gonna get a lot of people wanting to see this. What's 

[01:05:35] David: this style called again? 

[01:05:38] Jimmy: Uh, Mortuary Chic. 

[01:05:41] David: Dot com. I'd grab that right now. Yeah, you might 

[01:05:45] Jimmy: want to grab that.

[01:07:26] Jimmy: I've been chomping a bit. Alright, well, say it. I have to make sure I say his name right, so I'm going to look at my history.

Where is it? Come on now. The Secret Life of Machines with Tim Hunkin. I've devoured like six of his videos in the last two days. You guys know Tim Hunkin? I don't. We talked to him. The Secret Life of Machines. He's very famous in England because he was a This show, it's, it's, it's like a top gear, but for machines and it was all made in the eighties and the videos are still just as important.

The Secret Life of Machines, Tim Hunkin, and I'm actually just on his personal channel where, which is interesting because he'll do. These were all, seemed like they were kind of reposted about two or three years ago. He'll show the episode, and in the episode he's 30, 40 years younger than he is now. He might, I don't even know if he's still alive.

He's an old gentleman. And then at the end, the last 5 or 10 minutes of the video, he'll show the whole episode that was just reposted from BBC, and then in the last 10 minutes he'll talk about the episode 30 years later. You see, in that episode, when we showed, like for instance, they did a thing about car skins.

How the development of the car skin. Did one, of course, about the motor. One about the sewing machine, he does a deep dive, and like I said, because the history is the history, these episodes are still very, very potent, with, rife with information, and uh, he'll say, oh, in that episode we, we faked this because we had the whole camera crew sitting around and we had to do something, and then, so it's pretty interesting when you watch the episode and then he does the, the, the postscript at the end.

And he's also 35, 40 years older. So you see the guy in the video, and then you see him, and like, it's hard to imagine it's the same person. And, uh, The Secret Life of the Photocopier, which was great. Because, where did, how do photocopies start? Where did the Xerox machine come from? Yeah, so it's just great.

So his name is T I M H U N K I N. That's his channel, Tim Hunkin. He was the host. And I, I remember him popping up. We might have talked about him quickly years ago. Two 

[01:09:32] Bob: years ago. I do, now that I see it, the videos, I do remember you bringing it 

[01:09:36] Jimmy: up before. He did an episode on springs. I mean now he does the episodes.

I think he does more like YouTube versions But this show I didn't really know about so I if you go to The Secret Life of Machines is the actual show that the BBC published, and now he was the host of, but now his newer channel, his newer stuff, is just him doing things to the camera like we do. Anyway, check him out.

[01:10:00] David: Cool. What you got, David? Uh, YouTube channel called Dear Modern, and it's all about feng shui, and I thought feng shui kind of meant the flow. A room, but it goes in so much deeper than that of placement of things and how you, why you don't want your back to a door and why you would want a desk in this particular position.

And I started going through the rabbit hole of, of this YouTube channel and it turns out he also has a book. So I just started his, his book as well. It's just. So, Feng Shui is, I casually was looking something up and now I'm down this huge, huge rabbit hole. So, it's called Dear Modern.

[01:10:52] Bob: Cool. Uh, I have two. One, I'm trying to look up because I forgot what the name of it is. I pre ordered a book by our buddy Andrew Huang. It's called Make Your Own Rules. That was the name of the book. It's for pre order. So, Andrew Huang is a musician. He's amazing. He's just, I don't even know of another word.

He's amazing. Um, and he wrote a book that I'm very excited about reading because he's just... An incredible musician, but also just a really nice guy and a really, he has like a really interesting way of thinking about things and looking at things. So he wrote a book about making music and being a creator and all this stuff and it's for pre order right now.

So I'm excited about it. I'll put a link to it in case you want to check it out. The other thing is a video by Steve Mould and Steve Mould is, I've met him a couple of times. I don't know him well, but I've met him a couple of times and he's Ridiculously smart, um, and he makes really cool videos. So, the other day he, he did this video and I saw it as pretty much as soon as he posted it and it was like at 26, 000 views.

Uh, this was two days ago. Now it is at 2. 2 million. And it's called A Cast Saw on Human Skin. So he does this whole video about how a cast saw works and why it does or doesn't cut your skin when they're cutting a cast off you. It's pretty cool. I'm looking 

[01:12:22] Jimmy: at it now. Yeah, that's great. Oh, I follow this guy.

I guess I stopped watching him. 

[01:12:27] Bob: And there's a really funny, he does an ad spot. In the video and it just I laughed out loud for some reason it really caught me off guard because he's talking about how this saw works and then talking about like I wonder if I could shave with this and then he like goes on and he does this thing and all of a sudden he goes into this ad spot where he's half shaved like just half of his face and for some reason it really made me laugh but anyway it's a very cool video it's neat to see a saw like that and it's how it's built for its 

[01:12:54] David: purpose there's this creator named max flosh one of my absolute favorites i uh he's the one i have uh notifications turned on for and he's so brilliant at doing ad spots there's one time he took his sister to court uh to i forget what the video was about but while max was in court he started to do his ad read and it was just it was so good it was oh yeah if you yeah wow that's all i got that's a check out max vosh as a uh extra homework
