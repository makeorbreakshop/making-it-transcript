395-Making It
===

[00:00:00] Bob: Uh, now I don't know how to start the show. Go. Okay, so we don't, we don't have a good way to start the show, so we're just gonna start the show. Go. The end. Thanks for listening, everybody. I'm about to leave for a vacation here in just a little while, so we're fitting in one last show this week before I leave.

We're not gonna have a show next week, or I don't know, you guys can have a show next week. I'm not gonna be here. Where are you going? 

[00:00:23] Jimmy: Can you 

[00:00:24] Bob: tell? I'm going to, uh, the beach with my family. There's a soccer tournament over spring break. So, we're going to spend a couple days on the beach and then play a bunch of soccer.

And then, after that, I'm going to another kind of private event on the way back up. Um, meeting a bunch of other YouTube people. And, I'm looking forward to that. That's 

[00:00:45] Jimmy: a thing I wasn't invited to. I don't know. 

[00:00:48] Bob: I don't know. It's smaller this time than it was last time. So, I think a lot of people were not invited to it.

Um, but I think it's smaller on purpose, so. 

[00:00:58] Jimmy: Dave, you and I will have our own thing. 

[00:01:00] David: Yeah, I don't know. I have no idea what he's talking about. 

[00:01:02] Bob: And we can talk about it in the after show. 

[00:01:04] David: And then, uh, for the Patreon members, will you post the coordinates of the beach that you're going to be at at the 

[00:01:09] Bob: time?

Sure. After I leave. I will. Absolutely. Go check it out. What have you guys been up to? 

[00:01:18] Jimmy: I'm almost finished with my boat. I'm in the home stretch. It'll be exactly 11 months since I started it. When I'm... Wow. When I call it done. I started May 5th, and now... Uh, yeah. It'll be, actually, 12 months. 12 months. Yeah, it'll be, uh, it'll be three weeks shy, two weeks shy of 12 months.

[00:01:38] Bob: Wow. I mean, you could just procrastinate a little bit and make it... Right at one year? 

[00:01:42] Jimmy: If you want. Well, I have to post it this month. So yeah, I promised I'd post it by two this month. It's a Carolina Shoes sponsored video. And it's, uh, so happy it's over. And I keep thinking, where am I going to run it?

Because the little lake I was thinking I was going to bring it up to, I can only row, I can't run a little motor. And I have a little motor, which needs a little fixing by, maybe today I'll get that motor. It's, it was completely restored from, horrible condition but there's just like two or three little tweaks it needs to be done and this is 1920 johnson motor it's really it looks really cool on the boat it looks like something from the 19 20s, the boat thing went on, it looks really cute.

And I actually bought a janky set of row of, uh, uh, a janky set of oars off of Amazon. I will ultimately make, make a set of oars. Hang on, hang on 

[00:02:31] Bob: just a second. What were you gonna call 

[00:02:32] Jimmy: those? Uh, I was gonna say... Row... R Rowing Devices, I don't know what... Rotors. You 

[00:02:38] Bob: said row, and I was like, I know he means ore, but it sounds like he's about to say rowing spoons.

Because that's just rowing. There's your title. Sorry, proceed. Yeah, so 

[00:02:46] Jimmy: I was gonna, I'm gonna make a pair of rowing spoons eventually, but... In fact, this week, so you guys ever see like the big, the big utensils on the wall that kind of feel African, the big utensils, like in the 70s they used to be all over the place for some reason, like a big fork and a spoon that would hang in the kitchen.

So those are two things, I'm going to make those on the bandsaw this week. So when I make them, I'm not making rowing spoons, I'm making large kitchen utensils for fun. But I bought oars, they're kind of ugly looking, they look kind of sporty, I was going to kind of sand off some of the colors on them for the video.

I was thinking this piece of property we just got has a tiny little pond on it. I can't call it a lake because it's... Actually, you can. With some creative, yeah, with some creative photography, I might make this thing look bigger than it really is. 

[00:03:32] Bob: No, I actually looked this up. When we've moved to Kentucky, what is the difference between a lake and a pond?

Thinking that there was some sort of a size requirement, there is no difference. Hmm. You can call either one, either one. Oh, there you go. They're just still bodies of water. 

[00:03:46] Jimmy: Hmm. So, I have a giant lake. If you're, if you're an ant. Well, that's a lie. A giant lake. So, I was going to maybe do it there, because there I could play with the motor on private property, but there's this big, beautiful lake that has American bald eagles, and people go there to watch the bald eagles, but you can't run a motor on it, you can only use, use uh, rowing spoons, so, I'll see, I'm excited to give it a shot.

I'm not, I'm not a big water lover. I'm excited to get it in the water and get it done, but I'm not looking forward to, like, falling in the water at the water's edge, you know, all that fun stuff. Get my boot soaked. 

[00:04:21] Bob: Is that why you don't like it? Or do you just, like, not enjoy swimming, or... Like, do you not want to get wet, get all of your clothes wet in the wrong context, or do you just not really enjoy water?

[00:04:32] Jimmy: I'm not, I'm not a huge fan of going near the water. Really? In general. I used to like the ocean when I was a little kid, but then one day I was like, this isn't fun. I'd rather be in the workshop. I 

[00:04:45] Bob: mean, I agree with you.

I don't like the beach for a different reason. Just cause, if there weren't for sand, the beach would be alright. But the sand part is... 

[00:04:57] Jimmy: yeah. Yeah, the sand is horrible. Well, that's cool. Yeah, so, and then, uh, oh, my bandsaw tips video is doing well. It's funny, uh, we were talking last week about, you know, videos doing bad, doing good.

And the bandsaw tips video, I figured would do okay. And last night I looked, it got like 25, 000 views just yesterday, like four days later. Wow. Like, when you look at the graph, it goes like this, and then goes up at the very end. That's insane. Which is very, very exciting. It's something you don't see a lot of these days.

So I changed the thumbnail. I've never really fiddled with thumbnails. We could talk about this more when we talk about the subject. But I never really fiddled with thumbnails. I know both you guys have played with that. But I've been experimenting with playing with thumbnails and putting them on my community page at Drew's request.

Drew, uh, Drew Witt has been giving me some guidance. And I put up a video that had... 60 something thousand views where I make the ab crunching thing that you put your elbows on and lift your knees. That video I changed the thumbnail to some innocuous ugly little weird thing in the video because those things you see this it's like this is something I never would have thought and then it's got 16 million views and you go and it's a guy who like cut a two by four and a half and put a hinge on it for no real reason.

You know, so I'm kind of taking a playbook. I'm taking a page from those playbooks and so I just grabbed some random thing and I'm like I needed this to be healthy. That was, and I got 4, 000 views overnight from a video that I posted three months ago. So crazy. I'm experimenting with that this week. So if anybody sees some weird posts on my community page, I'm just seeing if anybody's paying attention.

Trying not to get too clickbaity, but I was doing the trick bait thing that we talked about.

What else am I working on? Oh, I started working on some leather wallets. The video will be out in a couple weeks. I'm kind of ahead of the curve with some stuff. And yeah, I, I'm working on this boat. This is a fake boat. I've showed it on Instagram for Blue Point Brewery. It's a big fake boat that's been here since November.

And that's almost done. So thank God that I'll get my whole floor space back. And then I promise I'm going to start working on the pool table. That I keep telling everybody all the time. Wait, 

[00:07:10] Bob: pool table boat. Pool table 

[00:07:12] Jimmy: boat bar. Pool table boat bar. That you use... Big spoons and fork. Row spoons. It's funny, 

[00:07:22] David: our pool table has not seen the light of day since last summer.

We started getting vanities and bathroom stuff in late summer, early fall, and They would end up on there, and then as we had a place to put the vanities, as they were building the bathrooms, we had no linen closet, so it just became a place to put sheets and towels and stuff, and it is just, and it's still not completely uncovered, so.

We have a pool table, but it's just a big place to put stuff, and it's worked out well for that. 

[00:07:58] Bob: Yeah, it's a table. It's a table. Yeah, our ping pong table. Has been that for as long as I can remember, it's just a giant surface that holds a lot of stuff. So, that holds a lot of stuff. Yeah. Well, uh, David, what have you been up to?

[00:08:15] David: We've got one video that I don't want to talk about too much, but in the style of my Facebook ads videos, they've done very well. So... Uh, in that particular style, we shot a video of buying the five most expensive tools on banggood. com. Are you familiar with banggood? Mm hmm. So, uh, and it's way more legit than the Facebook ads videos for sure, because you get, like, tracking and real...

shipment notifications and everything and everything came pretty quick and right away so yesterday we shot me kind of like using and reviewing all those tools and I think that video is coming out on Sunday And I don't want to give away the outcome of that, but that was really, those are really fun to make.

And then those tools, if we ever find that second property, we're going to have a tiny little minimalist shop and those tools will end up in that tiny little minimalist shop. So and then tomorrow, Daniel's coming back over and we're going to work on the Magna Doodle video. I think we talked about that last week where we went and bought a Magna Doodle.

So we took it apart. And when you, you draw on the MagnaDoodle, it's got a white screen, and then you use the little magnetic pen, and it brings up these little metal dust pieces to the screen, and it kind of sticks. When you take it apart, and you flip it over, it's inverted. So the whole screen is covered with the little...

Metal dust, and then where you, and then where you drew, yeah, it's, it's white. It's, it's kind of cool. 

[00:09:54] Jimmy: Yeah, the magnet doodle was the holy grail in the early 90s when I was in the toy business. Everybody wanted their version of a magnet doodle. Hmm. We used to take them and break them apart. There's like a little gel in it, and you just pull these iron filings from one side to the other with a magnet.

There's like a little, 

[00:10:10] David: great idea. Yeah, there's a little honeycomb pattern in there that holds the, holds the little shavings. 

[00:10:18] Jimmy: And then when you to to erase it, you swipe it with a magnet which pulls everything away from the face. You know the Yeah. Viewer face pulls it to the back. 

[00:10:25] Bob: Yep. It's cool. Okay. I gotta switch gears.

David, I have your next idea for you, please. Do you remember Wooly Willy? Yeah. You need to make a Wooly Willy of yourself. Oh yeah. Because you don't have any hair up top, you can easily shave your beard. You can make your own. 

[00:10:44] David: I forgot about these, yeah. 

[00:10:47] Bob: Please do that. You can make like a cool frame to put around it, and little pictures of yourself with like different versions of a beard, you know?

Yeah. Oh man, that'd be so cool. 

[00:10:56] David: I totally forgot about this. Every kid my age has had one of these. Every single kid, yeah. 

[00:11:02] Bob: Like, you could make that, you could recreate the type up top, like with your name and some other, you know, clever thing, and like, have it 3D text. Oh, 

[00:11:09] David: yeah. It would be fun to do the whole thing out of wood, because it looks like it has, Jimmy, what's it called?

The little J hook hole for the... 

[00:11:19] Jimmy: Yep, that's it, the J 

[00:11:20] David: hook. Like, just incorporate that into the wood so it looks like it's supposed to hang on a, on a J hook, yeah. Oh man, that brought back some memories. 

[00:11:30] Jimmy: You can make a little vacuform seal front for it if you have a machine. Yeah, 

[00:11:34] David: oh you can really make it without the machine I think, just with a heat gun.

Um, these are the types of things that the grandparents would get us to keep us quiet on road trips. 

[00:11:46] Bob: Yeah, it's like you go into the convenience store. And there's like all the cheap toys right up front, and like, you know, Mad Libs and stuff like that, they would get that just to, yep. 

[00:11:57] Jimmy: Remember there was a thing with somebody's profile and a chain, and you're supposed to like move the chain around like a moving line?

Like, maybe it would be for the nose. Oh yeah, yeah. It's like a side pro, it's like a line drawing of somebody's face from the side, but like the nose to the, from the bridge of the eyes to the top of the lip is a chain, so you could change the shape of someone's nose. You ever see that one? It's like in the Wooly Wooly category.

Huh, crazy. It's like a little black chain and you could move it around and it's just like a moving line. 

[00:12:22] David: Those little, uh, you remember the little, the, uh, we could, this show should just be nostalgic toys. The little, it's filled with water and it's got the little pumps on there and you try to get the rings to land on.

[00:12:32] Bob: Yeah. I've thought about making one of those in a, there's a different shape, cause I, that thing is just a cool mechanism. Yeah. To do 

[00:12:39] Jimmy: that. Me and my sister had all those. That was exactly my age window. I remember Christmas morning we had like five or seven of those things. My dad bought all the different water pumps things.

Hmm. It was funny. You squirt water to get the things circulating. 

[00:12:54] Bob: Cool. Well, um, yeah, so I think that should be your next project. I just decided for you. It's on the list. It's on the list. Uh, let's see, anything else? You doing anything else? I didn't mean to interrupt you. No, I think, 

[00:13:07] David: uh, um, that is, that is it.

So you got the Banggood video next, and then we'll work on the wooden magnadoodle. Cool. 

[00:13:17] Bob: Well, I've been working on, um, my stairs. I have a set of stairs going up to my boys room that kind of converted attic space. And it was the last big area of carpet in our house, because I took up all the carpet when we moved and put down hardwood floor.

And the stairs, I knew that there was nothing underneath the carpet, you know, other than just like a 2x8. So I've kind of avoided dealing with it. But finally getting to that, and I've got kind of a... Interactive idea that I'm working on electronic stuff to put around the stairs and, but it's, it's taking a long time and turns out to be a lot of work.

So here's an interesting thing. You know, like when you're, when you're looking at stairs, you have the skirt. Sometimes you have a skirt on the side of the stairs, like a piece of trim that runs up like a diagonal line up the staircase, and then it. It follows the up and down of each stair. I would have assumed that they, and this is just me not knowing any better, I would have assumed that they would put down the stairs, and then they would cut those, that skirt, with the stair pattern, set it in place, so that it could be pulled off.

And then, especially if you're carpeting, you can carpet over that, cover the seam between the stair and the side of the skirt. Well, apparently, at least in our house, and I looked it up and it's pretty common, that they actually... Put these uncut 1x12s down against the wall, they paint them, and then they lay the stairs.

In front of them, which I guess makes sense if you don't ever plan on taking up the rough stair tread and rise, you know, if that's always going to be there, then that doesn't matter. But then you have a piece of trim, a big piece of trim that's built onto the wall behind a stair tread that you can't take out.

So I was making an assumption because I was going to take it out and do something with it and it's behind the stairs. So I ended up having to go back with the little, we call them Zerp Zerps, the, you know, the rotary tool. X Tool. Yeah. And, or whatever, oscillating tool. So I had to go back and actually cut that stair shape.

This is like a 13 step stairwell. That's a lot of work. So I had to go, yeah. 

[00:15:35] Jimmy: You got a lot of replacement blades in that, those things burn out fast. 

[00:15:38] Bob: Actually, I went through one blade and it didn't actually take as long as I thought it was going to. Oh wow, that's good. Which is kind of crazy. But, um, yeah.

So I ended up cutting this thing off and then there were just a couple of finish nails that were holding it against the wall. So it was not hard to take off, but it just seemed like a weird choice. But I guess in the construction at that point, you're just trying to get it done and you're, you know, it doesn't matter how it's connected if it's being covered by another layer.

Mm hmm. But anyway, so that's one thing I had to deal with the other day. That slows it down. So this whole thing is going a little bit slower than I expected. 

[00:16:10] Jimmy: So you're reskinning the set of stairs. Is that what you're doing? 

[00:16:13] Bob: Yeah, and then building on some electronics using some lighting and some sensors and stuff to make it more interesting.

But... It's kind of a level up type video, so the beginning of it is, okay, you can take up some carpet, you can get some stair treads, finish them, lay them down, and like, you can have better stairs. And then, you can do this. And then, you can do this. It's one of those kind of things. Um, and I think it's going to be pretty cool, but it's, it's turned into those second and third layers of and thens.

I kind of thought through them, and then I kind of didn't, so as I'm going along, I'm like, oh, oh yeah, I forgot to put a thing for the thing, hmm, 

[00:16:54] Jimmy: I forgot about the... Was it going to be like a piano, just a set of piano keys, and like, boop boop boop boop? I 

[00:16:58] Bob: did think about that. I did think about that. Boop Uh, and I decided against it for a couple of reasons, but...

Mainly because my kids are going to go up and down it, and that would get old after about a minute. 

[00:17:10] Jimmy: Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop. You gotta make them go like, boop, 

[00:17:13] Bob: boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop. So I thought it'd be cool, originally, to do that with a song. So as you went up and down the stairs, you were playing a song up, and then a different song coming down.

But then that introduces, you gotta figure out... Which direction you're going and if you have more than one person on the stairs, yeah Yeah, yeah, 

[00:17:31] Jimmy: if you heard if it went like the like like a cartoon up and Down you would know which direction everybody's going That's true

I'm losing my 

[00:17:45] Bob: voice, I can't even go high notes. Totally unrelated, I don't know why I'm telling you this other than it was just funny. So the other night, one of my kids had strep, my youngest had strep. And he was alright, but we gave him some medicine, he had a fever, he went to bed. And so we go get in bed, and then after a few minutes, I hear somebody coming down these stairs.

And they're all covered with cardboard and then tape and stuff right now. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. No, so I hear him coming down and I go out and I'm like, Hey buddy, what's going on, what are you doing? He's sleepwalking. He was like totally out of it because of the fever and his medicine. So he just like plops down on the couch and he's like, you know, I'm just, uh, I just, I just came down.

I'm like, okay, but you need to go to bed. And he's like, yeah, I gotta go to the bathroom though. So he gets up and starts to walk to the bathroom. I'm like, well, go up to your bathroom upstairs because you're sick and, you know, we're keeping the germs in one place. And he's like, okay. So he just turns around and walks up the stairs.

I go back to bed. And then a minute later I hear people yelling. And so I run upstairs. And. He's in the bathroom, just went to the bathroom, but he's standing there still asleep, and he is so upset, and he's having some weird hallucination dream, and he's like, I had a hundred dollars! This is like a ten year old.

I had a hundred dollars! And all of a sudden, it just went away! And I'm like, 

[00:19:01] Jimmy: okay. He's dreaming about being a YouTuber. You need to go to bed.

[00:19:08] Bob: I was like, you need to go to bed, and he was so distraught. And it was like one of those moments where I was laughing really hard, but I also felt bad. Because to him, it was totally real, and whatever he was dreaming was, you know, actually happening, but... So we got him back in bed, and then he got upset again, and then it turned into a thousand dollars.

Then he had a thousand dollars, and it just literally went away! 

[00:19:29] Jimmy: That's how life works. He was a YouTuber with nine years under his belt. 

[00:19:34] Bob: Yeah, he was just dreaming about taxes. Anyway, that was a funny thing semi related to the stairs only because he was going up and down the stairs. So I've been working on the the stair thing and we're gonna be skipping like this week and next week is the while I'm gone is gonna be the soccer goal video thing that I was talking about.

We finished that one up. And then Josh is going to be doing another bed for one of his kids, a different, totally different style bed. So he's going to, they're going to shoot that while I'm gone. So there'll be a video on the channel that I'm not going to be in at all, I think. Um, so that'll be kind of interesting, just something different for us.

So yeah, we're doing that and we're actually, uh, we're beginning to get ready for a trade show. Have I told you about this at all? So, did I talk about it on here? That I don't recall. Okay, so, it's kind of weird. We're, we're doing more with selling our courses. And we ended up having a conversation 

[00:20:39] Jimmy: with... Oh, you did mention this is a trade show for schools.

[00:20:42] Bob: Yeah, it's like homeschool convention. And so, I guess I didn't talk about it. So, basically... Uh, while I've been working on these videos, Josh has been designing and building out the, um, our booth. And it's just a weird thing. I went in yesterday and there's like a mock up booth in the office with like tape on the floor for the right size.

And we're like, the table's there and we're trying to figure out like, okay, well, where do you come in and where do we put the point of sale for people? And how are we talking to the, you know, like, where does the brochure go? It's a totally different thing for us to think about. And, um, it's kind of interesting to see.

everybody's attention shift to something that's it's related but it's a very different it's a different has like a different intent and so we're having to think about sales and keeping people at the booth but not keeping people at the booth too long because it's you know it's only like 10 feet wide so you want people to pass through and you know having to like figure out is the best way to sell this just giving them a QR code and hoping that they go follow through or having a You know, a card reader thing there and attach that to sell the course and I don't know, it's interesting and it could be a really good thing, but it's a very different type of just overall big thing to think through.

I'm having to make a, um, which I haven't started on it yet, but I'm going to have to make a sled for R2D2 so that I can like, cause he, he stands at an angle, right? He's got three legs and he, and his legs are... You know, this front foot is further out, so the whole thing is kinda at an angle. And, I need to be able to move him quickly to get him into a car and out of a car, so I have to make a sled that rolls up behind him, straps around him, and then you can lean it back to get him off the ground and put the weight on casters.

It's just a weird thing, and other people have done this, it's not like I have to create this from nothing, but it's a, just a strange thing, you know, I have to make a... Sled for my robot so that I can get it in and out of a 

[00:22:41] Jimmy: car. Is he going to be there at the show asking people if they'd like to sign up?

[00:22:45] Bob: Yeah, pretty much. He's going to be there to get attention. 

[00:22:49] Jimmy: Should put like a fake Dilbert tie on him. Like just a collar, like a black tie. And a pen clip holder on his chest. 

[00:22:56] Bob: Just like a pair of glasses but it's only one lens. Just one big lens over his big eye. Yeah, so we've been doing that and uh, you know, getting ready to travel and...

All that type of stuff. So, that's kind of what I've been into. Um, we were looking for an idea, what to talk about today. And, I don't remember who said it. Who said the thing? I think Jimmy. I said... 

[00:23:24] Jimmy: What did I say? I was... I forget the topic, actually. I'm not taking responsibility. What is the topic? I forgot. 

[00:23:28] Bob: Oh, great.

It was something about, like, what do you do when you don't have an idea? What 

[00:23:35] Jimmy: did you say? Whoa, you, you download, you download. When you don't have an idea, you download a sound effects board. . Oh boy. I was looking for the stat, the star sound effect. I couldn't find it 

[00:23:47] Bob: carry on anyway, but it was like, alright, if you don't have an idea and you have to get something done, right.

Uh, I don't remember how you said it though. You said it in a very simple way, but what do you do when you have, 

[00:23:59] Jimmy: when you have no ideas, what do you do? 

[00:24:02] Bob: Yeah, and we've talked about. You know, many times, like, going for inspirational walks and things like that. So it's not, it's not a matter of that. I think it's more interesting to say, like, if you're in a pinch, you have to make a video, or you have to make a thing, or you have to solve a problem, but you just don't have the idea at the moment.

Right then, not like, I'm gonna go read books, and not, not that thing. Yeah. What 

[00:24:24] Jimmy: do you do? Well, it's, uh, I think I might have mentioned this last week, so hopefully this isn't boring, but the video that is doing so well for me right now, first time I did a good video in a few months, or have a high performing video, they're all good, just people don't know yet.

But the video of the model the mic again? Sorry, this cat hair ever. He blew in the mic before. So the model of the workshop I owed... I typed on the third video and I was kind of getting pressure to perform, to, to put it out because it was past its due date. And my agent said, when are you going to put out a video?

I said, I'll do it this week with no idea. And I had no idea what I was going to do because I already did the Eiffel Tower, which kind of came out cool. I did a bridge and then I needed something that like kind of summed up that series. I told them I was going to do ice cream stick videos. They loved it.

I thumbed through a book and I saw like a concept model idea, which I had written a long, long time ago. And I was like, okay. But it was just a few days. It was like, so it might've been the day before we started, might've been like on a Tuesday evening I thought of it and then put the video out Friday and now that video is closing in on half a million views.

But the idea of just, I sometimes go on autopilot where I don't, it's also because I've trained myself for so long to not worry about when the idea is going to come. I could always thumb through a book, look around a little bit, I start googling a little bit, you know, if I have like a notion of an idea but I can't see the finish, usually when I see the finish, when I can see the finish I can just jump right into it, that's the easiest part.

Well, I mean that's the hardest part is to see the finish and the rest of it is easy for me. But the, to get, to get to the idea. I just trust my instincts that something's gonna come, so I'm kind of on this treadmill where I have to put a video out each week. I actually enjoy the challenge of not having an idea on Monday, vaguely kicking around some ideas on Tuesday, nothing's really kicking in.

Wednesday after we talk I start solidifying an idea and then I usually kick on Thursday and Friday, maybe if I need Saturday I'll put the video out on a Sunday. And there are other videos, of course, that are in the background that are slowly developing until they're ready, like the boat, but in general, these sort of one week videos, I just rely on my instincts that something's gonna come up, and if it's, like, last night I did the spoon video for a reel, I'm trying to do a reel also, I'm just trying to develop my short form content, I didn't, I knew I wanted to do a spoon, And But I didn't think about what the wood was going to be or anything until seconds before I started.

And the inspiration was in the morning, I have this short spoon to get my coffee out of. I usually keep coffee grinds in a, in an old jar. And the spoon I have is too short. So I was like, I need like a proper spoon for this. And I could just use a metal one, but that's boring. So now here it is 12 hours later last night.

I was like, oh, let me do a spoon video. Let me make it a little bit longer so I can get at the bottom of that coffee jar. So like little bits and pieces like this. I'm a little bit of inspiration like the coffee grinds and stuff tend to put like a little pin in an idea throughout the day. But you just got to be conscious of it.

You got to be conscious of all the little weird idiosyncrasies that occur before your eyes. You know your eyes are sucking all this stuff in. So throughout the day you just got to keep sucking stuff up and relying on your history of idea generation. And you know, there is a friend of mine that's always like, I have no ideas, I have no ideas, I have no ideas.

I was like, I say this all the time, just find something in your environment and just remake it. There's things all around you, you know, find, I always use the napkin holder as an idea, but one day I'll actually make a real napkin holder, I'm going to make a, electronic napkin holder that tells you your mood when you say So it reminds ya It's like you've grabbed too many napkins at this point Can you reuse what's in front of you?

That's what the napkin holder is about to remind you It's like, really??? You've already taken 4 for this plate Really? Do you need another one? That's what it's gonna say 

[00:28:30] David: For your friend I would suggest Like Have a piece of Have a notepad and a pen on you All day. And then for that entire day, for that entire week, anytime you're bothered by something, the way you don't like the way something works, or you don't like the way something looks, or you have an issue, write it down, because that's a problem that you can solve with, you know, with your making skills.

There's so many times where I'm like, uh, I don't like how I organized this. And then that thought is just there for that particular moment. And then I never think about it again. Until it bothers me again, but if I wrote it down and it's in a place for me to look at, Oh, you know what? I got nothing to do this evening.

I'm gonna, I'm gonna work on making something. So for For myself, this is a, this is a thing that's, it's kind of in progress, how I'm trying to figure out how to move on to the next steps without ideas, but recently we've been working without plans, and I'm still trying to get over that, because I'm always worried that I'm not going to come up with something cool, but in the end, usually it works out just fine.

So, Magnadoodle project. I don't know what the, what it's going to look like at the end. I don't even know where we're going to start and that does bother me. But I'm pretty sure we're going to be okay. I'm just gonna, we're just going to go start planing some wood, we're going to start milling it up and squaring it up, and we're just going to work on one little thing at a time.

The Jimmy DiResta solution is just get to step one, and then figure out what you need to do to step two. A lot of times with what I'm doing, the cool stuff is all the little embellishments at the end. So I just gotta get the main frame of this thing done. And then just figure out, you know, what, how it's gonna be structured.

And then, the second half of the project can be all the cool little, little details. 

[00:30:24] Bob: All the fun stuff. That's an interesting point. Yeah, I mean, doing the utility, the necessary parts first. And then give yourself time to find the, the actual creative, like, last steps or whatever. Yeah, 

[00:30:37] David: give yourself time and also just kind of clear your brain of the, of the work.

And just, like, make room in your brain for the creative stuff. 

[00:30:47] Jimmy: Yeah, this might merely only apply to, like, YouTubers, but no, not necessarily. When, when I'm... Half baked on an idea and I'm not really feeling it or I know I want to go in the direction of making say for instance And I just I just looked at somebody's video of making a treasure chest Let's say I want to make a treasure chest and I don't know exactly what I'm doing or if I'm not really feeling it I'll go in on video collect the materials because I know that at least has to happen.

Mm hmm least at least to have a Me, collecting the materials, at least to begin the beginning of the transformation. So I'll shoot that for me. Once I have a vision, the rest is super easy. When I don't have a vision, it's still difficult, but sometimes I still have to start. Even if I don't have a vision, I'll get the materials and it'll start to solidify the vision.

So that, that helps to kickstart an idea. When you have no ideas, just pretend like you do. And. You know, at least if you can zero it down to a category or I'm gonna make an end table, or I'm gonna, I remember, uh, this reminds me too, like, I, I had to make, had I had to make a video for some obligation, there was a little advertisement in it and I didn't have a good idea.

And somebody said, oh, can you make a table? And I was like, table's so boring. And then like, it occurred to me like, oh, make three tables. So in the video I made three end tables. It was when I pulled my porch apart. So I made it out of the old porch planks. And those tables now are useful. They're around a couple of the beds in here in the house, but the video performed really well.

And I was just like, okay, how to make something boring, somewhat interesting by making three of them, three different sizes. And then I could also focus on different techniques of how I made them, even though they're very similar. I focused on different techniques each time I did one of them in the, in the build series.

[00:32:26] David: You said something that really hit me, uh, pretend that you have the idea. I, I think in the after show last week, I mentioned I'm going through guitar lessons to try to get rid of some bad habits and just learn some things that I never learned. And in one of the lessons, the instructor, he's just like, pretend you know how to do it.

And I was just like, oh. Uh, no, because you put these little blocks on, you're like, I don't know how to do that. I'm not, I'm not going to do that. But pretending you know how to do it, like it, it kind of changed. It flipped a 

[00:32:59] Jimmy: switch. That's, so, I had a really crazy, I, I didn't even mention if you guys notice that when ice skating this weekend for the first time in 40 years, I saw some footage.

I completely forgot about that. Paul Jackman did a video where he made a bunch of ice sticks with Total Boat and it was a Carolina Shoes video. And so he had, I think he made 1314 ice uh, hockey sticks. Did I say ice sticks? Hockey sticks. What is an ice stick? Did I say ice stick? What is an ice stick? A hockey stick.

Yeah, so he made... 13 hockey sticks and then he got us all together and he said, he goes, do you think you could ice skate? I was like, I haven't ice skated in 40 years. I don't think I can. But when I got on the ice skates for the first time, he had a bunch of his friends come and show up with gear. So we all had shared gear.

So I put on some strange ice skates first time. I was never also, I was always like nervous to put on hockey ice skates. When you're a kid, that's sort of like a threshold of like professionalism that you pass. You go from like the figure skating ice skates with like the The serrations at the tip so you can slow down and stop and then I put on so I went straight away first time in 40 years I went straight away to hockey skates and I Did good I did really good, but in the middle of like me first beginning to try it early in the day I'm like just pretend like you know what you're doing Just pretend and I just kept saying that to myself and then by the way, I was having a really hard time I was sticking close to the wall But then I got a hockey stick in my hand, even though it wasn't part of my video I just got a hockey stick to play with.

That helped my balance. And then just me leaning on the stick and pretending like I was playing. But I remember saying to myself that day, just pretend like you know what you're doing. And just watch the guys that are really good. Everybody was really good except for me and Graz. And just pretend like you know what you're doing.

And I kept saying that to myself. And the more I said that to myself, the better I got at playing. Well, I was just really, I was the referee, but I just. The better I got at just literally being able to skate, so I just kept saying pretend like you know what you're doing, so there you go, that's a good example of that.

[00:35:00] Bob: Yep. Um, so I was thinking when I was listening to you talk earlier, Jimmy, about how I, how I deal with this if I don't have an idea, and I very often don't have an idea. You know, I mean, that's a pretty common thing for me, it's not like I'm just flush with great ideas. And... I think I've found myself in the past when I get stuck and I just don't know what to do, I start going through the list of kind of tedious stuff that I have to do.

That's when like, the, the chores list in the shop kind of comes out. And, even though some of those, those problems to be solved don't really feel like they're creative to me. It can end up causing something creative. So like, if I get stuck somewhere, I'll just move around the shop and look for... Cleaning kind of does it, because it uncovers tools and it uncovers materials and stuff, but also just, alright, what's a thing that needs to be solved, that's not interesting, but it still has to be solved?

And it's, you know, how to hang these things on that shelf, or whatever. And in the process of doing that... You're, you're still working the muscle of problem solving, even though it doesn't feel like a creative solution. And usually that, that kind of like, getting sped up, getting spun up is the thing for me that is enough.

It just, starting to solve a problem ends up causing me to look at something else around that's in the space and be like, Oh, yeah, well, I could, I could use this instead. And then, then you just made a creative solution to a boring problem. That's the thing. It's the creative solution. It doesn't really matter how interesting the problem is.

And I think a lot of times I will get hung up in the other direction and I think I have to have an interesting problem to solve. I mean those are kind of hard to come by after a while, you know. So it's an interesting solution for me rather than an interesting problem. So I have to, I don't know, I just find something boring that's on the list, start working on it, and then, you know, that'll, that'll usually help.

Another thing you, you mentioned like when we were, before we hit record. We were talking, you said something about this, and I was like, oh, okay, well there's an idea, and you said, just hit record. And I don't know if you meant, hit record right now so that we can start talking about it and we don't forget, or if you meant, as a solution to this problem, just hit record, but it works either way.

Yeah, right, right, right. So, yeah, I think that's another really good thing. That's similar to what, you know, you've always said, just get started and something else will happen. I think it's the same idea. Like, go ahead and get moving. Go ahead and, and just... You know, grab your materials, or, you know, do the utility part.

I mean, we've all said the same thing, but I think... Making some motion toward the thing is probably... 

[00:37:40] Jimmy: Another good thing for me is I like going to Home Depot or Lowe's. You go, you go there and you start looking around. If you have zero ideas and you're like, let's say for instance, I gotta build something.

And we're talking about fulfilling the obligation of making a video, but in general if you're a home person and you want to make something and you, you, you just had to scratch the itch of making something. You know, you have Sunday off and you want to fill it with like a build. Go to the store and look around for a new tool that you haven't.

Like I bought the track saw this weekend. I bought a track saw, a Festool track saw, which I've never had. It's the first, actually it's really the first Festool I ever actually bought. When I was with Taylor, she bought me the domino jointer as a Christmas gift 10 years ago. So, I had that and now I have a track saw, so I have Festool.

So, buying a new tool will inspire a project that you wouldn't think of. 

[00:38:32] Bob: I think also, I mean, even without spending money though, the same idea can apply just with materials. I've gone to Home Depot before, walked up and down the aisles that I don't really have any business being in. You know, like the concrete aisle and stuff like that.

And, uh, I remember one time I had to make something. I don't remember the situation, but I just went because I was stuck on what the thing was. And I walked up and down that aisle and I saw those big concrete tubes. And then in the next one was like roofing material or something. And I ended up getting the clear plastic corrugated roof stuff.

There's some 

[00:39:08] Jimmy: cool stuff at the end of the roofing aisle where it's like no man's land. You feel like you're in a different story. Like, 

[00:39:13] Bob: Whoa. So all just seeing those materials in proximity to each other led to those giant lightsabers, those 12 foot long lightsabers years ago. And that was just because. I didn't know what to do and I went walking around, you know, in the store.

So I think even just seeing materials, even if you don't buy those materials, it can just give you a different set of inputs, you know, because I mean, it's easy. I'm with you on the buying tools. Like, if you get a new tool, you want to use it, but you have to pay for the tool. So 

[00:39:42] Jimmy: that's, well, that track saw showed up.

I bought it on Sunday or Saturday. And yesterday I used it, I'm working on a project for, uh... Hello? 

[00:39:51] Bob: I'm not here. 

[00:39:52] Jimmy: Hold on. My, my phone rang. Um, I'm working on a project, Taylor's got a client, so I'm building something for one of her clients, and I used the track saw all day yesterday. It was better than me wrestling sheets of MDF through the table saw, which is probably what I otherwise would have done.

But using the track saw laid out flat, I made such fast progress. I was like, wow, this is amazing. Yeah, it's something I wouldn't have thought to do. I would've just wrestled everything through the table. So 

[00:40:21] Bob: did that influence the solution at all or was it just simplifying 

[00:40:25] Jimmy: your work? Oh, no. Well, it's, it's a, it's, it simplified the work, 'cause the design is already done, so it's all written out on paper by an architect.

So I'm just making some cabinets. But it's, the idea of doing it that way isn't something that wouldn't have occurred to me in the past. I used to use a track saw often I used to use the DeWalt track saw, but having a fresh saw reinvigorated the, the approach. 

[00:40:45] Bob: Okay, so here's a pivot, a weird crossover that I just thought of because I'm looking at my notes here.

You mentioned earlier that you've been starting to change thumbnails. 

[00:40:54] Jimmy: Yep, with Drew's input together we're playing around with my, because it's like I have such a vast, a vast collection of videos that aren't doing great and even just like reviving them by changing the thumbnails and putting a mysterious trick bait name at the front helps.

So this 

[00:41:10] Bob: may be a little bit of an inside baseball thing for people that are not YouTube. I'm sorry, but, uh, what do you do there if you don't have an idea? So we're taking the same idea but applying it to thumbnail stuff specifically. Because naming drives me crazy. Last 

[00:41:27] Jimmy: night, uh, you said naming things drives you crazy?

[00:41:30] Bob: Just coming up with the thumbnail, wrestling with the whole, like, This is a video of the process of getting people to pay attention. It irritates me, but it's part of what we have to 

[00:41:38] Jimmy: do. Yeah, you guys should, on air, I'm saying this, you guys should have a meeting with Drew. He's got some really good ideas.

So you and, you guys should at least have a phone call with him. I'll introduce you guys. He's got some really interesting ideas and he's, and he's in the mix with all these guys that are doing well with all thumbnails and stuff. He talks to them often, so he really has a, uh, a good idea. Cutting edge knowledge of what what's expected and what's going on with that based on everybody's experience But that being said last night for instance, I looked at the video where I did the ab crunch machine, which is Didn't break 70, 000 video views in months.

It's been three months and I just picked a mysterious image that means nothing It's the image of the three pads laying on the table that I was working on the three leather pads that go on the machine And I I said I need this to be healthy And it's not, I mean, it might seem like clickbait, it's like I said, it's not clickbait, it's trickbait.

Because you're like, he does, what does he need to be healthy? Those three chocolate bars? So it just creates a little bit of a mystery. It seems like if you just create a little bit of a mystery, like in the past, I'd make a big wooden spoon, I'd be like, big wooden spoon, duresta. You know, it's like, it seemed like my branding was more important than anything else, and so now I'm, I'm foregoing my branding because.

What's more important is views and then the branding follows in suit, it's not necessarily the branding first. Because everyone's like, oh, there's that guy that shows off all the time, I don't need to see another video of him showing off. And so I stopped using my name in the thumbnails and I stopped putting, you know, this heavily branding stuff.

It's just, because when you see these videos that, 15 million views, it's like, don't ever do this. I never thought I'd throw this away. And then it's got, what is it? It's a piece of wood with a hinge. Information 

[00:43:18] David: gap. So you're creating curiosity. 

[00:43:21] Jimmy: Yeah. And so, yeah, exactly. It's like, oh, you want to, like, ask a question, or...

So there's lots of little tricks. So I just said, anything's better than what's there now. That was really how I started. So when you think to yourself, anything's better than this video's underperforming now. Anything I do, it can't be any worse. Unless I literally show a picture of a foot and say, I picked my nose.

I mean, that probably will do better. Ha! Here's a funny, here's a funny, now we're getting into like the Inside Baseball thing, but my friend Steve Casino, who's the peanut man on Instagram, everybody, Steve and I go back, yeah, Steve and I go back 25 years, he's a great dude, he's extremely creative, he's one of the funniest comedy writers I ever met in my life, when we hang out, it's been a long time since we actually saw each other in person, but when we were in the city together, we would laugh so hard, he is the funniest.

It's the funniest sense of humor. But besides that, this is indicative of a sense of humor. The other day he posted a picture, a close up picture of a Reuben sandwich, and it got more likes. It got 500 percent more likes than anything he's ever posted. So now he puts a picture of a piece of meat, and then you've got to scroll through to see his artwork.

And he says it in the last few posts, he's like, he goes, Well, for some reason everybody liked a picture of a piece of meat, so that's what I'm going to do from now on. Thank you, Algorithm. I love his 

[00:44:41] David: art. You should follow him if you don't. 

[00:44:44] Jimmy: Yeah, the peanut guy, Steve Cassino is his real name. Amazing artist.

Incredible toy inventor. He's been involved in so many successful toy lines over the last many, many years. It's just such a humble, sweet, funny guy. He's like, he's very much like David Letterman in a sense of humor. He always reminded me of David Letterman.

Go look at Steve's pictures of meat. The funny thing Steve does, he takes these, these gaming cartridges, which I guess to some people is super valuable, he takes these like obsolete gaming cartridges, and he'll cut a hole in them and have like the monster from the game climbing out of the crack in the, in the, and then the vitriol he gets for damaging a classic video game.

Oh yeah, I'm sure. And a lot of his posts are him having witty conversations with the trolls about him damaging the things. So they're very, very funny. It's like, it's really good fodder for being a silly comedian. But yeah, I, you know, it's uh, the worst thing you could do is just sit around and do nothing.

You have to start tinkering, you have to go for a walk. The worst thing to do, I said that my joke is I'm finally ready to be perfect. I'm finally, I finally achieved the ability to be perfect, there's some quote I wrote down. It's, you gotta just, you gotta, action will create more action. So to sit around and just literally wait for an idea to hit you like lightning, is just like sitting around waiting to get hit by lightning.

It's never gonna happen. You gotta walk out in the field with a pole, you gotta like jump up and down in the rain with like a golf club in the air. You gotta, you gotta provoke it. Not 

[00:46:24] Bob: actual advice, everybody. Just put a disclaimer out there. Please 

[00:46:28] Jimmy: don't do that. Go out in the field of lightning rods, you know, stuff like that.

That's the only way an idea's gonna hit you. Get a like, make a lightning rod hat, mention that, that would be funny. I 

[00:46:40] David: can 

[00:46:41] Bob: think of a couple people who might want to do that as a project video. 

[00:46:45] Jimmy: Colin Furze, he's going to make a lightning rod hat. 

[00:46:49] Bob: That's funny. So, 

[00:46:52] David: I have a question. Uh, Bob, you mentioned, you know, sometimes just going to shop and cleaning, sometimes that can help just be in the environment.

I don't, maybe I'm the only one in the world, but please let me know if there's anybody else that gets angry while they're cleaning. Something, like, something about cleaning, whether it's the house or the shop. All these weird thoughts, I pick fights in my brain while cleaning, because it's like, my brain, I'm doing something that I'm not wanting to do, I'm doing something that doesn't use any brain power, so then all of a sudden, like, I'm making up comments that somebody's putting on my video, and how I would respond, where I'm picking fights with, you know, a family member who disagrees about something, I don't know, I start thinking negative thoughts while cleaning, and It's kind of always been that way, and there's gotta be somebody else who shares the same 

[00:47:54] Bob: terrible feelings.

Well, I do have, I don't think I have like the always negative thing, but I do, I have noticed that when I get into a task, like edge banding, some, Really repetitive task, and it's going to take a long time to do it. I will start thinking about a particular situation, and then I will cycle that situation in my head, and I'll kind of go through a conversation over and over, whether it's good or bad or whatever, and just kind of replay it.

And, so I mean, I kind of feel you on that. Like, I do a similar thing. I think the way that I don't do that, is when I fill that inactivity with something useful. So, like, I've learned that when I do a tedious, long task like that, I need to be listening to a podcast, or an audiobook, or put a movie on in the background that I enjoy, that's gonna like, take me to, you know, different places throughout the movie, or whatever, just to keep my brain active.

Cause otherwise, you just sit there, and whatever comes up, is what your brain's gonna think about, you know? I do a lot of podcasts these days in my free time. Something 

[00:48:59] David: that helps with me in getting started with something is having a real deadline. I don't know if you can make an artificial deadline, but not having a deadline on something just allows me to put off the creative process, put off the drawing.

[00:49:19] Jimmy: Of course, you need to give yourself a deadline, I always do that, I'll say in the next three hours this is going to happen, like for instance last night I made the decking that goes inside the boat which was the last hurdle, and yesterday morning I said no matter what happens today by the end of the day the decking will be done, and I did get it done, I got a lot of interruptions throughout the day, I had to run around, do some errands, but by the end of the day, the decking was done.

[00:49:50] Bob: I think even somebody who doesn't have like a hard deadline, you know, I mean, you're, you have a long deadline that you're trying to hit to get the boat done at the end of the month. Right. So for a client, but even somebody who's just has the day in their shop, I think you could still kind of create a deadline for yourself in the, you know, this Sunday afternoon is my day in the shop and I need to walk away from that day with the day in the shop with something accomplished, you know?

Even without a client or without an outside influence, you can still kind of say, I'm deciding that I'm going to have a certain amount of productivity or process or whatever it is at the end of this time in the shop. You know, I think you can still put that on yourself. Because I know it would be easy if you don't have that outside influence to just be like, to just tinker.

And in the moment it feels fine that you're just spending the day like tinkering around in the shop and you get to the end of the day and you're like, man, I didn't really get anything done. I feel that way a lot. Um, but I think, you know, what you guys are saying, even putting that self imposed something at the end of X time is something you can do 

[00:50:57] David: for yourself.

A lot of times just writing it down on a piece of paper 

[00:51:00] Bob: makes it real. Yeah. I still, still think everybody should have a whiteboard in their shop. Uh, a big, you know, obvious, by the door, you can't miss it kind of thing just to keep ideas on, keep yourself accountable, keep measurements on, I still think it's like a really useful tool.

[00:51:23] Jimmy: My friend gave me a wipe off board, it's 9 feet long and like 4 feet high, and it's leaning on the outside of my barn, and it's leaning face in, I was thinking about just turning it around and just keeping ideas on it while I walk by it, because I can't dedicate a big space to the wall, and then if I did, I don't have so much junk along the wall, I gotta like lean over it to get at it, so.

I might just turn it around outside, it's more useful, even if it gets, the ideas get rained off it. It'll force me to think of new ideas. 

[00:51:50] Bob: I mean, cut it down, make it smaller, it doesn't need to be that big. Yeah, that's a good point. Mr. I Just Bought A New Saw? Yeah. 

[00:51:58] Jimmy: That's a good idea. 

[00:52:01] Bob: Cool, well, any other thoughts on?

[00:52:03] Jimmy: on this i think if you if you jammed up i mean my advice would be to just start doing something that's what i say all the time people sick of hearing me say that just do something don't do nothing because something leads to something else 100 

[00:52:17] David: yep i felt like that was a good one 

[00:52:20] Bob: Sure. I don't know.

[00:53:21] Jimmy: Oh, boy. That's a horrible, that's supposed to be applause. That's horrible. That 

[00:53:27] Bob: sounded like a, like a waterfall of gravel. 

[00:53:30] Jimmy: Yeah. How about this one?

This is just to announce the new, the new, the new person. Andy. Oh, wrong side of the button, hold on. Welcome Andy, come on in. Hold on, here it is. Oh.

Oh my god, this is, it's a toilet. Is he gonna gong in the bathroom? Look at the graphic, I don't know which side of the button I'm supposed to push. It looks like a 

[00:53:57] Bob: bunch of buttons with a word on top and below the button. It looks like 

[00:54:00] Jimmy: it looks like an elevator thing. That's what drives me crazy.

[00:54:06] Bob: So anyway, do you guys have anything to recommend? 

[00:54:12] David: I'm not talking over Jimmy's soundboard. I'm done, 

[00:54:15] Jimmy: I can't go on. 

[00:54:17] David: Um, uh, this interview that I watched last night, uh, it's on the GQ YouTube. It's Donald Glover, otherwise known as Childish Gambino, breaks down his most iconic characters. And it's like a 21 minute interview and it's, it's really good.

I think Donald Glover works on a different level than, than most of us. Um, I mean, he's an actor, a standup comedian, a, uh, and a musical artist. Like he just, he's constantly creating something and I'm just fascinated by how one person can do so many things in this interview, just kind of. You get, you get kind of be, you, you can just see that his brain works at a different level than, than everybody else.

That's a really good interview. Hmm. 

[00:55:05] Bob: Hmm. Interesting. 

[00:55:06] Jimmy: I'm trying to find the, this comes, oh, here it is. Uh, if, if you guys don't know who Paul Hamler is, he makes miniatures. He's been making miniatures for 40 years and what's cool about Paul is he's been a maker his whole life. He's closing in on 80 years old and he, he sent me, he, he's a, a really, really amazing sweet old man and he's, he makes incredible things.

So I'm going to send you guys this. It's a conversation with somebody who's closing in on 80 years old. And what's cool about him is like he's embraced every segment of technology that's come. He says it because I wish I had 3D printing years ago. He 3D prints, he CNC's, he laser cuts, everything it does to, to help his job.

And, uh, this is just a conversation with him on a podcast. It's an obscure podcast, but, uh, this is a great conversation with. This gentleman and he's such a sweet guy. We've chatted over the years. He's, he's, I, when he first started following me, I was so honored that somebody that this, this talented and skillful.

We Are Makers is the podcast. I'll just give you guys the link. So check out Paul Hamlin. He's 79 years old. I think that's what he said. Maybe I'm wrong. He's 78 years old and He makes things miniature, he makes mini rifles, and when I say makes them miniature, they look exactly, and operate exactly, like he makes mini 1911 handguns, he makes mini, he started making miniature classic tools, he got into collecting tools, and like the bug wasn't being itched, so he started mimicking them at 1 3rd scale, Paul Hemmer.

[00:56:52] Bob: Um, I don't have anything. I'm looking back at, I've gone through videos to last year and I just haven't found anything. I don't, I don't watch anything. 

[00:57:03] Jimmy: I'm gonna give you the second one. Okay, yeah, do that. So there's a great Instagrammer named Nicholas Birch. Birchhold, I'm sure, I'm probably saying his name wrong, B E R C H T O L D, he's, I met him at WorkbenchCon in person but we met over, over the internet a few years, about a few years ago.

He made this beautiful aluminum, um, cut of my head, it's kind of like a shifter knob, but it's my head in aluminum. He is a master at modeling and a master 3D CNC machine. To his advantage. His stuff is incredible. So, check out, he does these, uh, beautiful Like, a couple weeks ago, I bought a mallet from him, button Looks like a button tufted mallet made out of, like, leather, but it's all obviously CNC'd out of hardwoods.

But he does this texture on it, which makes it look like it's made out of, like, beautifully tufted leather. And he's making this treasure chest. He made this beautiful treasure chest. So you see like this button tufted stuff he does, it's all out of walnut. Oh, 

[00:58:04] Bob: I've seen 

[00:58:04] Jimmy: that, ok, yeah. He's known for this thing too, but you gotta go to his page to see the dirty word.

You see, he makes, he uses a dirty word and he makes a lot of things out of a dirty 

[00:58:15] Bob: word. Oh, I see, yeah. Yeah, 

[00:58:18] Jimmy: we can't show that. 

[00:58:20] Bob: Gotcha. See the dirty word? 

[00:58:22] Jimmy: Yep. Yep. And he makes multiple dirty words and he makes some things with the dirty word texture. I see. But look at, look at that beautiful chest. Sweet guy.

Oh, I forgot. I just said the pun. I didn't 

[00:58:36] David: really. Anyway. People are piecing it together now. 

[00:58:39] Jimmy: Yeah. 

[00:58:42] Bob: Cool. Well, I don't have a pick, so you can just 

[00:58:44] Jimmy: take two. Oh, and then, I have another bit of news before I forget. I'm looking at my notes. Oh, okay. So, Paul. And I and everybody we did the hockey game the other day and everyone's like this is so much fun This is so much fun Mike from Totalboat was there and we're all like we should do this again.

And so now Paul is thinking about doing a either annual or two to once a year or twice a year hockey game of Makers, so if you're a maker and you want to play ice hockey In the Northeast, or if you want to come up, whenever the event is, you can come from wherever you want in the world. Paul is putting that together.

So reach out to Paul Jackman. I don't have his contact to give out, but you find him on his comment section and his Instagram. Paul wants to put together a, let me see if he gave me a contact to reach out to, because he texted me about this. But, he wants to try and put together a, let's see.

He just said to have him send him a message, so look for, look for Paul on Instagram, JackmanWorks. If you want to play ice hockey. And I'll probably come to each one of those, just for physical punishment.

Cool. But it was exciting being on the ice playing, even though I was playing a fake referee, it was really exciting being on the ice. And like, we were all just goofing around, slap sticking and doing stuff. I was just trying to stay up. And as soon as it was like, okay, we're running out of time on the ice, he rented the ice for a two hour window, let's get to the game.

And then the game started and it was, it was on. Like, even though it was a joke game, it was on. These guys were really aggressive. Derek played ice hockey in high school, so he was very good. Several of the other friends that were there, uh, friends of Paul's, they were all very, very, very talented. So it was a fun game.

Like once it got going it got really, it got real. It was fun. It was fun. That's cool. So I could see like a real competitive game with like real makers having fun. And then everyone has to show up with their own handmade ice stick. 

[01:00:33] Bob: Hockey stick. And then everybody walks away with broken hands and they can't do their jobs for a 

[01:00:36] Jimmy: while.

Ice. Everyone's gotta make their own 

[01:00:39] Bob: ice stick. Ice sticks. Alright, cool. Well, uh, thanks for listening everybody. We won't be back next week. We'll be back the week after that. And, uh, we'll see you later. 

[01:00:49] Jimmy: Thank you. Love you. Just get started. Just get started.
