401-Making It v2
===

[00:00:00] Bob: We're just gonna go for it. We got no idea, no topic. We barely had any pre discussion. Everybody was like looking at their screens and doing their own things and myself included. So we're just gonna go for it. Don't scold me. Don't scold me, Bob. Hey, I'm not scolding you. You're an adult. You're way older than I am.

I'll say that every chance I can. How you guys doing? 

[00:00:25] Jimmy: I'm doing pretty good. Pretty, pretty good. Pretty, pretty good. I'm doing alright. I'm jamming. I'm jamming. I got 

[00:00:34] David: a, I got a weird comment the other day of, uh, somebody they didn't like when my voice goes real high when I talk in my videos. 

[00:00:41] Bob: Well, that's a nice thing to 

[00:00:42] David: say to somebody.

So I need to do a 

[00:00:45] Bob: lot more. What a weird thing to say to somebody. Yeah, 

[00:00:49] David: they're like, oh, I like your videos, I just don't like it when your voice goes up to that higher pitch. I'm still going to watch though. I just hate it when you talk. Yeah, I hate it when you talk. Yeah. Oh man. Like, oh. That's 

[00:01:02] Bob: crazy. Thank you.

Yeah. Well, what have you guys been up to? David, what have you been doing? 

[00:01:07] David: Reading comments. Reading lots of comments. Uh, this week we started doing, uh, an IKEA hack. And we got this metal cabinet. Uh, from Ikea. And a couple of nights ago, I just sat it on the bench and I just stared at it until something, something came to mind.

And so we started to, we cut some pieces off and then added like a wooden frame to it. And I can't give away too much, but, um, I think we completely transformed this metal Ikea cabinet into a nice piece of furniture. It's not completely done yet. And the video won't be out probably until a week from Sunday, but I'm pretty, pretty darn happy with it.

[00:01:55] Bob: That's cool. Well, now you've got my curiosity peaked. Yeah. 

[00:02:02] David: Pretty, pretty. Um, there's a lot of IKEA hacks out there, um, but they're all like, you know, cutesy little DIY things. I think this one's a complete transformation, so. Hmm. 

[00:02:13] Bob: Yeah. Nice. Put wheels on it, make it into a go 

[00:02:19] David: kart? Well, I thought about putting wheels on it and then making it into like, um, like a, like a whiskey cart.

Cause it's kind of how it came out. Um, I don't know that I want it to be that. So there's still time. A lot can happen. Just like, just like today's podcast, a 

[00:02:40] Bob: lot can happen. It's never too late to put wheels on something, right? You 

[00:02:45] David: know, you are 

[00:02:46] Bob: 100 

[00:02:48] David: percent correct. Yeah. Yeah. When in doubt, put wheels on it.

That's right.

[00:02:55] Bob: Cool. That's what I've been doing. Are you speaking of wheels? Um, are you still doing go-kart stuff? Haven't we have not talked? I haven't, I haven't heard from go-kart things from you about go-kart things in a long time. Yeah. Uh, 

[00:03:07] David: dealing with a pinched nerve and I just, oh, I'm not ready yet. Yeah, that oldness hitting me pretty good.

Oldness. Um, I'm. I feel 100 percent right now. I could probably race. Uh, I just, I'm scared. I'm scared. I'm going to do it again. Cause it, it's not a thing that just goes away in a few days. It, it lingers for a long time. So I should probably just be healthier, do my stretches, go out for more walks and runs and bike rides and stuff.

[00:03:42] Bob: Have we talked about yoga? I know we've talked about like health stuff and, and I am 

[00:03:47] David: not opposed to yoga. Um, it 

[00:03:49] Bob: looks difficult. Can I give you my experience? Please. Okay. Not try to push this on anybody, but I had a lot of back problems. I've had a lot of back problems, like most of my life. Pains and pinched nerves and muscles that locked up for days on end and stuff like that.

And when you guys were here. You remember like I could stand up and I couldn't really sit down. Like I couldn't get in a car to go with you to see the office. That was, that's how bad it was. So after that, the doctor was telling me different things. And she was like, basically, if your body is beginning to do that, if you're getting old enough that your body does that.

Lockup thing or pinching a nerve, it's going to do it again. And so it's going to keep happening. You just have to figure out the best way to get your body to release that stuff. If a muscle is locked or something. Um, and so she recommended a few stretches and then I started looking into those stretches.

Turned out they were yoga stretches that were a part of like a bigger set of things to do. So I eventually downloaded this app that I wish was sponsoring, but they're not called Asana Rebel. And it's basically like a workout app. But it's for yoga and it turns out yoga is really hard. Like it's one of those things that at least, you know, 10, 15 years ago got thrown around as like, it's a, it's a, like a, a chill way to just spend your morning in the quiet with.

It's not that at all. It's hard, very hard body work, weight work, stretching in weird ways that you're not used to stretching, but, and I've been, I've been enjoying it. So I've mixed that into, I run a little bit less than I used to, but now I do yoga a few times a week to kind of stretch out and it's really, really helped my back not hurt as much, but also when it hurts, it's helped me to stretch out the stuff to make it hurt for a shorter amount of time.

Yeah. And... It's so weird, one of the things that I learned that is like the simplest thing that everybody should just know, it's called a forward fold, and you basically stand up straight, and you roll your head down, and you fold yourself in half, not pivoting at your waist, you know, like folding in the middle, but you try your best as you, I mean, you can't actually do this, but you try to roll your body down forward, let all of your, you do it slowly, you let all of your Vertebrae try to move independently.

Like I said, you can't actually do that, but you think about it that way. So you roll all the way down, see how far down you can go to touch the floor. And the first time I do it every day, I can get like my fingertips on the floor. And then you roll back up and then you roll down again. And when you go down again, the second time I can get my palms on the floor.

It's crazy. And if you can feel it, you feel stuff like loosen up and release and anytime, especially in the mornings, but anytime that I'm feeling like tight in my back, I'll just like take a minute, roll down, touch the floor, roll back up, back down again, and I can feel it.

All that to say, uh, yoga is hard work, it is a workout, and builds a lot of muscle that you don't expect, but it's also a great way to stretch out stuff that you don't know how to stretch otherwise. So, I would highly recommend it to anyone. How 

[00:07:02] David: many pairs of yoga pants do 

[00:07:04] Bob: I need? Uh, you, you start out with 10.

That's the starter kit. And, and none of them are black. So like the black is once you've leveled up. So you start out with, you know, you start out with like the pink, red, yeah, yeah. It's like, it's like belts. Yeah. So don't start with black. Cause then you're just a poser. Like it, you look like you're like a yoga person and you're not.

Everybody can tell and stuff. So I'm just kidding. Um, yeah, the only thing you really need, and it's weird, we already had these because Jenny's done yoga for years, is a yoga mat. We have those. Pretty inexpensive. I've never used them before. I'm sure we have those. Yeah. They're good for putting over other things that are dirty on the floor.

We use 

[00:07:48] David: it as an entrance mat, uh, mat to our house. 

[00:07:50] Bob: Yeah. Anyway, I would recommend it though. Seriously. Being able, just knowing how to stretch out a few different parts of your back as a, an older person, man. I don't know if it's just men or women or what, but as you get older, like that back is problematic.

So being able to stretch it out as big, I don't know if that would affect your shoulder. I have no clue, 

[00:08:11] David: but, uh, yeah, so the first time. That I had the pinched nerve. That was the absolute worst because that was six months of recovery. And I think like 15 or 16 sessions with a, um, physical therapist. This time I went to a chiropractor, uh, and I, uh, the stretches that they give you at home, um, are pretty much the same between the chiropractor and the, and the physical therapist.

And in that world, those two Uh, occupations, um, buttheads, like physical therapists, you know, do not, uh, typically do not recommend going to a chiropractor and whatever. Um, both were helpful and I think because I tried to nip it in the bud. I'm not going to go into the details right away. I only had a few weeks of recovery instead, but I really enjoyed going to the chiropractor just for the adjustment that crack the back and the neck.

It's, it's a little, if you've not done it and they, they've snapped your neck real quick, it's, it's a little scary. But when I walk out, I just feel. So good. 

[00:09:17] Bob: I'll, I'll weigh in on that. I hate 

[00:09:20] Jimmy: that. Okay, I wouldn't, I don't like, I don't like chiropractors when I do that. I see people, my buddy is a chiropractor and I would never let him touch me.

I watch him touch other people and I said, you know, I know 

[00:09:30] Bob: some people enjoy it. But man, I've been, I went to like when I was having back problems a while back, I was finally broke down. I'm like, sure. I'll try a chiropractor. Not a big fan. I'll just be honest. I'm not a big fan of them and went like twice and the dude yanks my neck around and it makes me feel like I'm about to die and I don't.

So I didn't go back, um, but that guy did recommend, this was years ago. He recommended a YouTube channel that does yoga stretches. And so it's a free, you know, whereas the app that I'm using is a paid app and stuff. Yoga with Adrian. I just looked it up. A D R I E N E. I'll put a link to it. I've only watched a couple of her videos, but she does have some really good stretches.

It's all free. It's all on YouTube. I'll put that down in the show notes, if that's helpful to you or somebody else. Speaking of YouTube, 

[00:10:17] David: um, so one of my, one of the channels that I've subscribed to a while, and I think I recommended them a couple of years ago, it's called Bob and Brad and they, um, they're physical therapists and they have a, uh, lots of great stretches and, um, Foot pain and back pain and neck pain and, and stuff like that.

And unfortunately one of them developed, uh, shoot, I forget what it's called, but he had to step back from the, the channel because he couldn't talk clear anymore. Oh gosh. And, uh, he, oh, I wish I could, I'm gonna try to speak intelligently here. 

[00:10:56] Bob: So that's a podcast. You don't have to do that. Uh, 

[00:11:00] David: so Bob, uh, uh, uh, Ataxia.

So, and it affects his speech. And, so he had to step back and have somebody else coming in, in the place. And, it's just a really, I'm gonna, maybe this is my pick of the week. I'm gonna pick Bob and Brad. Because there's lots of good stretches for old people like us. 

[00:11:23] Bob: Bobandbrad. com. Bob and Brad, yeah. I should get a domain like that and just pick a random name as my buddy.

[00:11:32] David: They have the best opening jingle out of any YouTube channel in the world, but like, I'm not gonna sing it, but it's really, really good and it's gonna be worth your time because you'll be, you'll be singing it at the grocery store later.

[00:11:50] Bob: Cool. Well, Jimmy, what have you been doing? I'm just doing 

[00:11:54] Jimmy: a little bit. I try. I have to, because when I was doing the bicycle, when 

[00:11:59] Bob: you were doing the bicycle, 

[00:12:00] Jimmy: I'm doing the bicycle. When I began doing the bicycle, I, to be perfectly honest, since the winter is ended and spring is here, summer's here, I'm so much busier.

It's hard to keep a regular schedule. So I'm like, if you look at my sketch, you could see it publicly. You'll see him on the bike for two days. Then I'm off for three days. And I'm on for three days and I'm on for one day off for one day. It's been really tough. I've had visitors here and so I got. Today I'll get three days in a row.

It's hard. I was doing it every single day up until I started traveling and then that just always throws off your schedule. But I am doing at least three to four days a week every night if possible, but because of logistics and people being here and whatnot, it's been tough, but I'm not giving up, but I need to stretch because in the beginning I wasn't stretching and I was getting these incredibly painful muscle pulls while I'm in the middle of just doing something else.

All of a sudden it feels like somebody's... Put in the back of my calf with an ice pick and the pain is just incredible and you have to stand up and you feel your legs crunching up and everything. But um, it's, it's definitely important to stretch as you get older. I need to do it more often. Like that, that roll thing you described it definitely to do that.

Cause sometimes things fall on the floor and I just go, I guess I didn't need that. And I just like kick it until... That's where that lives now. Yeah, I guess. That's just going to be on the floor from now on. It's, it's been, it's definitely. You get achy, especially when you spend days moving around a lot. A couple weeks ago, we moved all the printing presses, and the day after, I just was really tight.

Oh, I bet. It wasn't a pain. It was just, you just felt the pain. You just felt the tightness from having moved so much. Yeah, it doesn't get easier as you get older, I'll tell you that much. But I know keeping moving is really important when you stop moving, that's when... 

[00:13:44] Bob: I think one of the hard things, where like, the place I'm at, as physical stuff becomes more difficult and, you know, you're sore, you're sore longer after.

I kind of imagine that that's the place where people either... I don't know if they implicitly decide this or explicitly, but you either go like, okay, well, that means I'm just going to do less from now on. Or it means I'm going to figure out a way to continue to do what I do and recover faster or, you know, be smarter about those movements.

And it feels like that's kind of a point in your life where you, like you set your trajectory for how active you're going to be in your older years. Maybe I'm thinking too much about that, but. I've had to look at, like I hurt my ankle, uh, on Easter playing kickball with my kids, and it still hurts. That was a couple of months ago.

And so my internal reaction to that is like, okay, does that mean I just don't do things like that anymore? Or do I figure it out how to do them more safely? Or do I just deal with the fact that I'm going to have things that hurt forever and go hard on things anyway, you know, you can kind of decide how that goes.

I mean, have you all run into that? 

[00:14:59] Jimmy: Yeah. What did you decide to do? I try not to do that again, you know, like the doctor says, you could doctor every time I, uh. What's the joke? Every time I take a sip of coffee, I feel a pain in my left eye. You should take the spoon out of the coffee. Did you hear that 

[00:15:16] David: one?

This is new 

[00:15:18] Jimmy: to me. Never heard that one. Or when you tell the doctor, it hurts when I do this, and the doctor says, well then don't do that. Okay, that's a good idea. 

[00:15:27] Bob: But see, if that's the thing, if the answer is don't do that anymore, then you're just creating a list of 

things 

[00:15:33] Jimmy: that you're not going to be doing.

I'm being silly, but no, you just gotta exercise and keep active. I notice that at my age, the more active I am, the less I feel. feel the impending doom of old age, but when you stop moving around and when you get sedentary, that's when you start to not want to move. It's almost like, it's like the, the laws of motion, bodies in motion, stay in motion.

If you stop moving, I know in the middle of the day, I usually take a break at like four o'clock to stop and check emails and maybe have a bite to eat. That's tends to be kind of my lunch window. And right there, it's harder to keep moving. So sometimes if I'm have momentum on a project and 3, 4 o'clock rolls around.

I just keep going because I know if I stop then I'm going to get lazy and I'm just going to sit down for a minute then I'm going to talk on the phone and someone's going to visit and then forget it. And then all of a sudden 4 o'clock rolls into 8, 9 o'clock and then I go back out in the shop at night.

I do that anyway, but it's nice to keep moving and getting things done. My grandpa's... Definitely need to stretch more. 

[00:16:35] David: My grandpa's phrase is keep moving. That's just what he says all the time. He's going to be 101 years old next month. That's unbelievable. He has slowed way down, unfortunately. And he stopped making the crosses a few weeks ago.

And he sold his truck. This has all happened in the past few months. Um, yeah, he's... It's been obvious, like, he's... He's tired now. 

[00:17:00] Bob: Yeah, yeah, that happens. I mean, and no matter how much you want to fight against it, eventually we all get tired. Yeah, we all get tired. 

[00:17:10] Jimmy: Yeah. Yeah, my dad's 83 and uh, he's definitely slowing down.

Definitely. We're gonna hang out with him this weekend for Father's Day, but he had a double knee replacement about 20 years ago and That slowed him down a little bit, but now old age is definitely slowing him down. Yeah, it's you know, it's it's what happens He knows it too and he you know, he's like I can't deal with it anymore.

You want that? He used to be very possessive about his stuff and he's like, you want that? Take it. I'm never going to use it again. And he's starting to get into that, that headspace. 

[00:17:41] David: Yeah. When I was over at grandpa's last weekend, there's just this random like painting on the wall, like a fake painting.

And he's like, you want that? And I knew what that meant. And I was just like, yeah, 

[00:17:55] Jimmy: I'll take that. Yeah.

[00:18:02] Bob: We all are on every end of that conversation. Eventually we will be the ones that are trying to give away our stuff too, because we know we don't need it. I think we should do it on the podcast. Oh, okay. Just to each other? Here, you want this bandsaw? Yeah. 

[00:18:18] Jimmy: Do you know how many 

[00:18:19] Bob: episodes that would take? Oh my goodness, just bandsaw transfer, car transfer.

[00:18:26] Jimmy: Rob, somebody asked me this week how many land rovers you have, and I said it's just two, right? I 

[00:18:31] Bob: have zero land rovers. I have two land rovers. That's offensive. 

[00:18:35] David: That's 

[00:18:37] Jimmy: offensive. He froze up, he just hung up on us. Oh, he did 

[00:18:40] David: freeze. 

[00:18:41] Bob: Did I really? 

[00:18:42] Jimmy: Yeah. So what do you have? Not Range Rovers, not Land Rovers, but 

[00:18:46] Bob: Land Cruisers Toyotas.

[00:18:48] Jimmy: Oh my goodness. Three? I always thought there was only two. 

[00:18:50] Bob: No, there are two. Where'd you hear three? 

[00:18:53] Jimmy: No, no. Three categories of the same name. Land Rover, Range Rover, and Land Cruiser. 

Range 

[00:19:00] Bob: Rover is a model of Land Rover. 

[00:19:04] Jimmy: Wait, so you have Land Rovers? What do you have? No! Oh 

[00:19:06] Bob: my goodness. They're like my kids.

I have a Toyota Land Cruiser. Cruiser? Land Cruiser? There is a separate vehicle that's called a Land Rover Range Rover. And yes, that's a dumb combination of names, and you should tell them that. So there is 

[00:19:24] Jimmy: only two that have a confusion symbol in it. Three, but two are in the same 

[00:19:27] Bob: company. Well, yeah, yeah, I mean, you have the brands.

You have Land Rover and Toyota, right? The Toyota has the Land Cruiser. Land Rover has a Range Rover and a Defender. Those are the two, like, big off road. Vehicles that they have. Oh boy. The rest of them 

[00:19:43] Jimmy: just... But you only have two physically vehicles that have a name that's similar to one of those names.

Yes. 

[00:19:49] Bob: That's a good way to put it, yeah. 

[00:19:52] Jimmy: This is what happens when we don't have a topic. If somebody suggested you had like four or five, I'm like, no, he only has 

[00:19:58] Bob: two. No. I have those two and then I have the gear. Yeah. That's it. You only have three gears, right? I have eight GIAs. They're all stacked on top of each other.

No, uh, the GIA, uh, you haven't even said what you're working on this week, but I'm gonna jump in anyway. The GIA, um, I started doing body filler on one side of it this week. It's like, actually better than it was last week. Is it looking good? I mean, no, it looks terrible, but it's, that's how it has to go before it gets, but it was really cool.

Cause the, this one big section of the side where there's lots of like, you know, the, the rust where it ate into it. So it's textured, it's not gone all the way through, but you know, it's not smooth. Um, just man, 10 minutes of work fills that up and gets it. You know, sandable, then there's a bunch of sanding and stuff, but it's just amazing when something that has been a little spot that has been ugly and problematic for several years now, all of a sudden is better.

Yeah. And then you just move on to the next one and all of a sudden it's better and it's, that's really, really cool. It feels good. You know? That's good. You feel progress. That's good. Yeah. Anyway. So what have you been working on? What were you? Well, this 

[00:21:11] Jimmy: week I had visitors and a lot of people on Instagram might've seen.

I had Corin from, uh, Australia and Neil Pasks from PaskMakes come, came and spent the, yeah, they got in Wednesday. They left. Sunday. So we had a really, really good few days in the machine shop. And it's funny because K's very, very specialized knife maker, machinist and knows a lot about a lot of things.

And we, he, I, I had this old stat hardness tester, it's old to me now, but I bought a brand new, well they gave it to me 'cause I work with stat. So Ster gave me this hardness tester, which is several thousand dollars machine and I never got it working. I thought it was broken. On a pallet, and the parts inside were a little jumbled.

It came from far away. And he walked in my shop, he hadn't been here for like 20 minutes. I was showing him around and he goes, I could fix that for you. And then about an hour later, I got a long phone call and I came in and he had it all. He took it. He just took the time to go out there and work on it, get it fixed, and, and then we would joking about how, uh, I have all this.

Scrambly machinery around that needs help. Everything needs a little attention, right? Everything pretty much works, but then my lathe, the next day is like, what are we doing? We're not going to stand around here and do nothing. We got to make something. So Neil and Corin helped me get the go kart. I had just started it the day before they got there.

So the go kart was on the... The workbench and we jumped in and I told them I needed bushings and then the lathe was having problems, so they took the lathe completely apart and got that fixed. It took a little bit of a couple trial and errors till we realized what we were all doing wrong, and my friend told me, and then, so we got the lathe fixed and.

Then it was all hands on deck just working on the go kart, which I did not plan on doing, but I'm really glad we did because we've gotten so far along and Neil is amazing. If you don't, Neil's my recommendation this week, Neil Pask. If you don't know what Pask makes, you got to check him out. He's does great stuff.

And just his curiosity is amazing. He's just has the curiosity of a child and just curious about machines and materials and metals. He made a couple of brass accents for the go kart, including the fenders. The go karts got this kind of like turn of the century, first kind of car ever existence kind of look with like a wooden deck.

We're going to put wooden planks on the deck. And so each wheel has its own little fender and I had this big tube of brass. So we cut this tube of brass and cut it into four sections. So I have these long curves. They're just, so it's like. 3 inches wide by 15 inches long with a curve in it on the short direction.

So now how do you curve that so it's curved all the way like the fender on a motorcycle? That's what we basically made. And we tried all different stuff. So it was a really great day of discovery trying to figure out all different ways. At the end of the day, just heating it up and hammering it into a wooden buck that was similar in shape was really the only way to get it, at least with what the tools we had.

So that was a great day of discovery. And it was, it was interesting hanging out with another maker. I would have given up and changed directions because I would like have this. Impending doom that I have to have it done fast and he didn't seem to have that which is something I it was it was enlightening Let's try this.

Let's try this and I'll be like, well, we can just go that direction We don't have these like no No I like this way this looks like he was like on that and He was gonna figure that out and we did and so that was a great learning experience hanging out with those guys So then I'm doing that, and that's, I'm really far along on the go kart.

I thought maybe I could have it ready for this weekend, but I'm going to have it ready for next weekend for a video. This weekend I think I might do a leather video. Um, anyway, so I'm going to be working on that. But the pool table is still well underway. I jumped back onto it late last night, moving some of the steps along, and today I'll make some more headway on the pool table.

But the pool table is really out of the woods, as far as all the technical... Nervousness that I had about the whole thing. So I'm really happy at the direction it's taken. It's, I think it's going to be a good build. It's really coming together. Is it, 

[00:25:06] David: uh, how are you going to get it out the door and into another door?

[00:25:13] Jimmy: The whole thing comes completely apart. Yeah. Yeah. Even, even the slate itself breaks down into three pieces. Gotcha. But to set it up each time is. It's a complicated task. Me and Rob were thinking about that last night because originally he was going to go to the Las Vegas Woodworking Show in July and it was, that was a whole big thing and then everybody realized the logistical investment in time and money and they said, forget it.

So it's just going to be a video and I'm going to keep the pool table where I could sell it or give it away, but I have to figure out for the beauty shots, I'm probably just going to keep it set up right where it is and then when I need that footprint, I'm going to. Get rid of it and put it in storage or something because the concept of putting the felt on and all that stuff is a real big investment in time.

But since, um, I have the floor space in the shop, I'm probably just going to leave it in there. I'll probably leave it there for a couple of weeks. Well, you know, just to relish in the idea of like, wow, I made a pool table. And then once I stop my car or truck restoration, it's going to have to go. I'm going to figure out where to set it up.

Well, I 

[00:26:15] Bob: said it before, you know, it's never too late to put wheels on something. So you can always put wheels on the pool table and just roll it from place to place. 

[00:26:22] Jimmy: It might have to happen. It might have to happen in the shop because it would be a shame to take it completely apart to move it 10 feet, you know, and obviously we're not going to be having.

X Carve, X Tool, X Skate, X Carve Pro, X Tool, X Skate, X Skate, X Skate, X Skate, X Skate, And a little dish. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I could probably 

[00:26:51] Bob: do that. That's a good point. I've got those under the plasma table right now, so I can roll it around. 

[00:26:55] Jimmy: Yeah, so that's a good idea. So I'll probably do that. The floor in there is pretty flat, so...

It'll be at least good enough. But like I said, if... If I was going to hold a competition, I'd have to have it really set up. Anyway, I'm just thinking 

[00:27:08] Bob: out loud. You could put a motor on it and take it to the racetrack. Yeah. That's an idea. It could be next year's go kart. 

[00:27:14] Jimmy: Yeah, that's a good idea. No, so the build's coming out good.

It was like, it's just that mental hump that you put on yourself. And you think to yourself, Ugh, I'm never going to be able to figure this out. And then you just like, chip away at it. It's just like, chip, chip, chip, and then all of a sudden, oop, wow, I'm past the hardest part, I didn't even realize it. So that, that's, that's what's been going on, you know, that's always the case, chipping away at the hardest part.

Oh, and I put the house video up, the video where I introduced the house that me and Howard bought, and it's fun, I get a lot of people. Write me about the historical aspect of the house. A lot of people doing some research on the graveyard, which is great. So one step at a time, chipping away at it. When, 

[00:27:55] David: uh, I mean, we don't have a topic, so.

Your pool table now doesn't have a deadline. So when does that build end? 

[00:28:05] Jimmy: In a year and a half from now. Right? Because you... No, no, I'm going to try and get it done by July, the end of July. Yeah. 

[00:28:12] David: Is there... Will it be done done or I always feel like a lot of the projects that I do I could keep going on I could Keep adding little embellishments.

I could refine this I could do the finish better on this But it's the deadline that makes me stop. 

[00:28:28] Jimmy: No once it's done. It's once it's done. It's gonna be done Because it'll look good. It's 

[00:28:34] Bob: good. That's a very Yoda thing to say, man. Yeah. 

[00:28:37] Jimmy: Once it's done, it's going to be done. It is. Yeah. There you go. I, I, it's not like the, the boat with the boat.

You could just keep finding so many things. I feel the pool table is you just, as long as the top clean edge is clean and the felt's not ripped and the bumpers are right. Yeah. It's a, you know, it's not the type of, it's like, it's just, it's there to present the slate. It's not the kind of thing where you keep looking at it and you go, you know, once it's set up, it's really more of like a you presenting the game and that's it.

Yeah, if that makes sense. 

[00:29:09] David: Bob, will the GIA ever be done? 

[00:29:12] Bob: Oh, man. Um, I don't think so. Yeah, I think it will be one of those things that just moves along in stages, but always has some other thing. Cause I was thinking about this a couple of weeks ago, even if I get, you know, I got the body all fixed up. I got to paint it.

I got to put back together. I got the engine rebuilt. I got the mechanical stuff in place so that it could be drivable. Well, then I could theoretically drive at home and then do all the interior work at home where it's easier to get to where it's more. And if, if you have something that is drivable, but not complete where, like you're saying, where is the, the impetus to like do the next stage, like to really finish it off.

And I think even if you did the interior stuff, then there's like trim pieces and like, you know, they're not really necessary, but they make it look nice. You do those. And then there's like, well, I mean, you could add this little thing over here maybe, but so I don't know. I don't know if it's ever going to be finished or if it's just one of those kinds.

[00:30:21] Jimmy: It brings up a funny story. Will it ever be finished? Cause a couple of people saw the daunting, the daunting task I've taken on with this house. And I said to Howard, I said, look, if we buy this house, even if we do nothing to it. Zero and just sit on it for two years. We will definitely make some money, but in the meantime There's absolutely gonna be some content to be had and there's definitely gonna be some progress in it in the workings of fixing it up There's no doubt.

Maybe it won't be completely done in two years or in a year from now, but that could change if Maybe I find an investor that's like, you know what? I want to invest in this. I love this idea I love this content and then here's a million dollars, you know, that's unlikely but it's not out of the realm of possibilities But just getting to the first step of getting your hands on it In my opinion, it's a huge step.

Some people want to have all those ducks lined up before anything. And I'm just not the type of person to make that plan. But in the comment section, everyone's like, Whoa, this is incredible. You're never going to be able to finish this. And maybe so, but in the meantime, we're here now and I'm working on it and I'm enjoying it and I'm enjoying the place.

I actually feel like a. A real, uh, not to get too mushy, but I feel like a real connection to the place. And I enjoy being there. And it's fun. It's just a fun project to consider. And, and I'm working with a set of guys that are going to help me do the foundation. It's going to be the first big task.

They're on another job. And as soon as they're done, they're going to get over here. So it doesn't seem like much is happening, but it's only because I have to do that before I do other stuff. And there's going to be a lot of that hurry up and wait. But the idea of will it ever be done? It's a good title name.

Will it ever be done? Maybe, maybe not, but I'm not gonna be overly anxious about that. I noticed a couple comments were like, whoa This is never gonna be done. We're like, how are you really gonna do this? I don't think that far ahead, obviously but Well, I didn't think that far ahead about this house and I've done so much to this house 

[00:32:19] Bob: You know, I never really thought about this until just now but But what we do for a living is finish things, like we make a project and then we have to finish it.

We have to get it to some point, whether it's actually finished or finished enough for TV. It's like it's done and then we get rid of it and then we move on to the next thing. So in my mind, like when you're asking about the GIA, and I think the house is probably the same thing for you. Having that thing that is just, it's always there for you to continue to chip away at, actually feels kind of good.

Because if I were to finish the GIA tomorrow, I would be like, well, I always wanted a GIA, and now that's done. I mean, that's kind of like how I felt with R2 D2. It took two years to do that, and then all of a sudden it was like, oh, well, R2 D2's done. That's kind of not cool, because it was a thing I always wanted.

Not that I wanted to have, I wanted to do it. And once I was done doing it, I don't really care about having it 

[00:33:24] Jimmy: so much. I had that same feeling with the boat. It was there for so long, and then once it was done, I was like, let me go work on the boat. I'm like, oh, it's gone. Oh, it's like a sense of freedom, but a sense of nostalgia.

And, uh, that's why I talked, I blew my, uh,

I bragged on too much about buying that antique car that I really wanted. Then I got into a little bit of a quarrel with the guy that sold the car and I didn't like the way he spoke to me and I felt like he was being disrespectful so I just literally backed out of that car deal completely because of the way I was spoken to.

This guy was trying to take, he was a little bit of a controlling personality and he got short with me and I said that's it, it's over, you can go sell the car to somebody else. But also I had been thinking... I have this house, which is, needs 100 percent of my time, and this car that I've been in love with, this model, not this particular car, and here's an opportunity to get one, and that would have needed 100 percent of my time, so, when I looked at both of them, I'm like, what am I gonna, I'm just gonna be spinning my wheels on both of them, neither one of them are gonna get really the attention they want.

I could own the car and just park it and not touch it for two years. Or, just not buy it at all and find one when I have the time to devote to it. And that's, and then the owner getting short with me and me just deciding, okay, back out of this is a good sign. So there, I was just confronted with two never ending projects.

And I was like, why don't I just have one never ending project with a slight chance of potentially coming to an end eventually. And that was part of that decision in the springtime. 

[00:35:00] Bob: Yeah, it makes a lot of sense. I mean, yeah, we only, we have limited focus. We have limited resource. We have limited time. And trying to do too many things at once, for me, it doesn't work.

But also moving from completed thing to completed thing constantly feels a little exhausting. And it's like, it's, it, It makes it so that when I look back, not in the moment, but when I look back on the things that I did a few months ago, that I just did a project and it was done, that feels really distant and kind of not important and not useful because it was just a moment in time, not a year or two or not a long term kind of thing.

But then when I think about the things that have taken a long time, like R2D2, they mean a little bit more because I had to invest. A lot more. And, um, it was a phase of life rather than like a week of life, you know what I mean? So, I, maybe that is a little cheesy and overly dramatic to think about it that way, but...

I mean, this is what we do and we invest a different amount of time and energy and focus and all that stuff into each one of these things we make. And so the longer term stuff, it requires more of all of those things, meaning that it took more from us, which we have a different attachment to it. I do anyway.

And I think the cars are. A new, a totally, and I know you've, you've had cars, Jimmy, that you've worked on different stages. You've had a different relationship with vehicles than I've had my whole life. And so I think for me, getting interested in working on a car, knowing that it's like a five, 10 year long project.

That's a whole new thing for me. That's something I'm just not used to and that's been why it's been both exciting and kind of frustrating and fulfilling and all those types of things. It's just a different, not only is the work different, but it's like a different scale of thing than I've ever done. It means something different to me.

I don't know. 

[00:37:05] Jimmy: With something like that, you gotta, you obviously look at the whole picture, but then you also have to just say, okay, I'm just gonna flatten the dents today, I'm just gonna fill in the cracks, or I'm just gonna work on the foundation. You just gotta really compartmentalize and stop worrying about the entire thing at the same time.

Move everything along mentally, if you have to, you know, by logistically planning. Like, for instance, I'm also working on the barn. I'm waiting for my team to be available so we could frame the barn. And so I bought the wood. This I saw last week. I had a bunch of wood on my truck last weekend and I got the wood.

And then also I got, uh, I ordered 10, 000 worth of flooring to put this. It's going to cost me 10, 000 to put the second floor flooring in. So it's just, everything is just so daunting. But by putting it on order and having it manufactured, once it's ready, and once it's ready, it'll be here. And then once my team is available to put things together, everything's ready.

So I've been doing the logistics behind the scenes, getting ready for my team. They're on another project, and when they're done, they're going to come here and work on that. And the foundation, a lot of things. A lot of things. Everything's going to get worked on. Yeah. So it's just incredibly expensive and time consuming.

[00:38:13] Bob: Yeah, that is a lot. It's a lot of investment. And both of those things. Um, I don't know if I've told you all about this. I probably did at some point over the past couple of years, but during COVID February, January and February of 21, I think I started working on this little electronics project and it was a cool idea and it was really difficult, but I had time to figure it out.

And it's been sitting right in front of where this camera is on my desk. For two and a half years. It's been like, I got it. 75, 80 percent done. And you know, it was like working functional. And then I set it there going, okay, now what do I do with it? How do I, what's the next step? How do I make a video about it?

How do I, and it's like, it's complex. It's a, it's probably at the top level of complexity of any, any electronics thing I've ever built and it's cool. And so it's been sitting there. For two and a half years. And, um, every six months or so I go, yeah, I should really like do the next stage. I should put that in the place that needs to go and start testing it and start, you know, there's the next level of work to be done on it.

I just never do. And for some reason on Monday. I had time and I just, you know what, I'm going to do the thing. And so I spent, I don't know, 45 minutes modifying this thing and putting it up where it did, I know it doesn't make sense because I can't tell you what it is yet. But just saying, I know I can't, but so I put it up and did the next step of the thing and it took like 45 minutes to do.

And now it's. It's not done, but it's usable. And it's such a weird thing. Where did you find 45 minutes? I, yeah, I know. Well, Monday, I just happened to have 45 minutes, but. It's just really weird that something like that, the step forward, was really small, but it took me so long to just, you know, like, just to dedicate a little bit of time to it, to move it forward, that one step.

And it's still not done. I still can't make a video about it. I, but... At least I have an idea and I can start to do the testing I need to do and all this type of stuff. It's just a weird thing because it's, it's, uh, it's something I kind of, like, I did work on and then I kind of wrote it off. Like, I just, I don't know, I don't know what the next step is.

It's like if I got the Ghia to a point and was just like, well, I don't know, I don't know how to put it back together. I guess it'll just sit here forever, you know? So, I, I don't know, have you ever had anything like that where you, you got it to like 80 90 percent and then it just set forever and you kind of...

Every single thing 

[00:41:08] Jimmy: I've ever made. 

[00:41:10] Bob: That's not true. I mean, I know that like you get to a point, like on the boats you've done, you do a lot of work for a long time and then it gets to a point where it's like kind of stuck or kind of monotonous or whatever. 

[00:41:21] Jimmy: A funny aspect, the boat itself was done on camera, looks great, right?

It's done, it works, it floats. But the finish itself needs to be sanded and painted like six more times. And I was like, I just don't have the time. I want to just get the video put in. So every time somebody sees the boat and they're like, Oh, it's so beautiful. I'm like, it needs to be sanded and painted like five more times.

[00:41:40] David: The last 10 of the project. 

[00:41:44] Jimmy: I think, why do I feel compelled to keep telling everybody that? Just don't say it. I just said it on the podcast. If you ever see my boat, you touch it. You know, I'm ready to put seven coats of paint on it. It just doesn't have that built up glassy coat. But then again, to me. I always say we're going to get a perfect, it's going to get banged up putting in the water anyway.

Which is funny because this week Nick sent me a message, he was asking me some technical questions, Nick Offerman about the, the canoe that he made on camera 10, 12 years ago that I filmed him making. Shit, that was like 15 years ago, 2000, how long ago was 2008? And And so he was showing me, he was asking me some technical questions about epoxy.

And I was blown away at how beat up that canoe is. He was showing me holes in it that got like punched through the thing because he, he really uses it. And the keel was cracked down the middle. And he was just showing me, he's like, these are some of the repairs I'm making on it. Am I going in the right direction?

Cause he hasn't used epoxy in years. But this particular brand, and I was just really blown away at how used that canoe gets and how much, how many repairs he was finally, he said, I finally have a minute to fix this thing. So, but I was just amazed how beat up it gets so that saying that I'm worried about perfect finish on my boat.

It doesn't matter. It's it's floats and it's sealed. It's got like four coats of paint on it needs like four more technically speaking so I can get a buildup so I can get a sand and a polish in it. All that doesn't matter. 

[00:43:13] Bob: Well, I mean, would doing that work make it less vulnerable to damage? 

[00:43:19] Jimmy: Uh, maybe, but it's just aesthetic.

Because it's just maintenance. You're going to have to do it again and again and again anyway. So if I decide to use that boat more often, which is probably unlikely because it's not my lifestyle. But if it does get used more often, it would need to be, it would need to be sanded and painted every spring if it gets used a lot.

That type of thing. Just maintenance. Oh, I just 

[00:43:38] Bob: had an idea. It's a bad idea. But I'm going to tell you anyway. Go ahead. So, um, you, this is stupid. You need to, you need to build a pond and a good place to do that would be around the graveyard. There's a pond, 

[00:43:51] Jimmy: there's a pond right near it. 

[00:43:53] Bob: Oh, is there really?

Yeah. Yeah. Well, I was going to make a joke about that. Building a pond over the graveyard. 

[00:43:59] Jimmy: No, there's one about 300 feet away from it. If you, uh, I did a couple of nice drone shots in the opening sequence and you could see the pond right behind the barn. It's kind of behind the barn next to the graveyard.

Is that on your property? It's the bond, the pond is on the new, new property, the graveyard house. Yeah. Wow. It's not huge. It's, it's little, it's enough to maybe get a couple of shots of like a boat in there, but it's, it's like, it seems like a little man made pond to just go swimming in that whoever owned it in the past made it.

[00:44:28] Bob: That's cool. Cool. Cool. Um, well, and let's see, I talked about the GIA. Oh, uh, small update that nobody asked for about a compressor. Uh, remember I was telling you, I was looking at a compressor for the plasma table. I got the plasma table hooked up this week. I got electricity run to it. Um, and got it all good to go except for air.

And so I've been still trying to find a compressor that wasn't like astronomical that would give it enough air. I finally found one last week and I guess over the weekend and I ordered it at a place, do you all have a rural King? 

[00:45:14] Jimmy: No, 

[00:45:15] Bob: it's like a tractor supply type store. Anyway, we have that here. They had this compressor cheaper, like 200 cheaper than anybody else for some reason.

I don't know why. So I ordered it and then was going to go pick it up the next day and then I got all my money returned and apparently they didn't have it in stock, which I guess is why it was cheaper. So I had to switch gears. I found another one that's a little bit more expensive, but it's like free delivery and whatever.

Anyway, so now it's supposed to be showing up today. Which is earlier than I thought, which is cool. But that means that I'll finally have everything I need to try out the Plasma Table. I'm pretty excited about that. Um, so, I gotta come up with a couple. I have a couple of project ideas that are... You know, they're kind of ambitious probably for just having gotten this tool and never tried it out.

Maybe biting off a little bit more than I can chew, but I'm going to jump in and try to figure out how to use it quickly and use it enough, you know, to do these couple little things, but... Will 

[00:46:21] Jimmy: you be making cut paths in Fusion? What kind of, how do you, what is the software? 

[00:46:25] Bob: Uh, they recommend something called SheetCam, I think it's what it's called.

It's kind of, I've never 

[00:46:31] Jimmy: used it, but I know people do use it. It's kind of, it's kind of like a Mach 4 for, for that type of 

[00:46:35] Bob: stuff. Yeah. Well, I think it's more of like the. You still use Mach four Oh for the machine control. 

[00:46:42] Jimmy: Oh, alright. So this is a design software? 

[00:46:44] Bob: Yeah. She Cam, I think is kind of just the two D cut path stuff.

Um, you generate your G code and then still send it through. Mm-Hmm? Mach four mm-Hmm. . Yeah. So I'm pretty excited about that. So just a new thing, you know, new world that I haven't messed with yet. And, um, your first 

[00:47:01] Jimmy: project, what, what thickness of metal are you thinking? 

[00:47:05] Bob: Um, it really should be like three eighths.

Whoa, 

[00:47:11] Jimmy: that's a lot. That's thick. Wow. 

[00:47:15] Bob: I don't think I'll start with that for my first test cuts or anything, but it should be probably three eighths, maybe quarter inch. I might be able to get away with it, 

[00:47:23] Jimmy: but... It might say it in your, in your, in your paperwork for the machine, but a lot of people reminded me because I was lazy in the beginning, you really need good, uh, moisture.

Trap something to eliminate the moisture in your system. And Torch Mate sells this big thing. It takes like, looks like crystals, where it all goes through it. It's like a really high. capacity, moisture removing filter. You need a moisture filter basically. 

[00:47:52] Bob: Yeah I've been told that and I'm planning on getting one but then I also saw a forum post by one of the guys that works at the company Hypertherm that makes the the torch and this this particular torch that I have apparently is really good at It has a um, it has some sort of internal dryer thing.

He was like, yeah, I mean you could certainly add another dryer, but this one does a pretty good job of, you know, handling that for you. So I think I'll still get one. It seems like it would be good just to have, regardless. You can't get it too dry, you know? Yeah, 

[00:48:28] Jimmy: also helps to empty out the air compressor once in awhile.

That tries me bananas. They make compressors, and they make these little valves so you can extract the water. It's at the very bottom, and they're usually impossible to turn. They're the size of the end of a pencil tip. And then when you can turn them, the rust clogs them immediately. It's like, is there a better way?

It's like they totally don't deal compressor at all. It's like, oh, oh yeah, it collects water. We got to get the water out. Let's get the smallest fitting we could possibly find, put it in the most inconvenient spot we could possibly find, one inch away from the floor. So we have to tilt over a 600 pound machine to get at the nozzle.

[00:49:12] Bob: The one I have at the farm, it's a big Craftsman. The one thing that I really liked about it is, it still has the rust problem, but that... Nozzle has an extension that comes out through one of the legs. And so the little, the little valve that you open is outside of it. So you don't have to get underneath it or anything, but it's still the same size.

It's still, you have to use basically a wrench to like get your hand around it to be able to turn it enough to release it once the rust gets in there. But, um. And I don't understand, I don't know if I told you all this or not, but the, the big, that same compressor, that's like maybe a year old, um, the check valve at the top failed, and this is at the top, so the air comes back up into the, you know, the output system, and so it was leaking, And I'm holding this up, everybody listening can't see this, but look at that.

This is the check valve out of that thing, less than a year old. That's been emptied. I never left air in it. And it's like rusty on the top. This is not at the bottom of the tank and it's brass or some, you know, not brass, but some version of, it's not steel or anything, but it is covered in rust. And it doesn't make any sense to me that something like that should be able to happen to something new.

So I had to order a new one. 

[00:50:36] Jimmy: Oh yeah. That one definitely looks like brass. The other one looks like it could be steel. It looks like it could be like a grade eight coated metal. Yeah, 

[00:50:43] Bob: I think that's what it is. It's definitely not brass, but it's kind of brass colored. It has that yellowish grade five, grade eight, something like that.

Yeah. But anyway, it's just weird that I totally agree with you. The internals of those things. They have compressed air that's gonna leak moisture. So why isn't the moisture like handled? That should be handled better. It's 

[00:51:06] Jimmy: another thing that now I'm venting my pet peeves, but that I've been welding a lot this week and it's crazy to me and I don't, I wish I had a better solution.

I'm gonna complain about something that I don't have the solution to, but the welding companies, the companies that make welding equipment, when you look on their website they always show a beautiful welder. They never show the cables, but when you get the welder, there's like an octopus of cables coming out of it.

Not even one thought given to like what comes out of what, like if I had, if it was up to me to make a welder, the ground cable would come out of the back of the machine and the important part would come out of the front of the machine. Only because they're right near each other. They're constantly getting tangled together.

So it drives me crazy. If one like came out of the opposite, I actually have taken some of my machines and zip tied the, the grounding clamp to the back of the cart so that it always gets wrapped up near there versus wrapped up near the front next to the other thing, wrapped up near the front. So cable management is something that I'm always on about.

I don't have a good solution just to what seems to work for me, but. It's always like, oh, we have a place to hang your cables. It's, it's like, it's like selling a car and an accessory would be the front seat. Like, you want this beautiful car? Would you like to pay extra for a seat? Of course I want to pay extra for a seat.

I need a seat. It's like, of course I want cable management hooks. You need them. I have a question for you. Why don't you just let it drag on the floor? 

[00:52:33] Bob: Plasma table question. So, I can look this up. But, um, the ground clamp from the plasma, Torch. In my mind, could go to the bed because it's aluminum with steel fins and then you're putting a piece of metal on top of that.

They all recommend clamping it directly to the workpiece. Is there a reason why you wouldn't just put it to the machine or to the bed, I guess? 

[00:53:00] Jimmy: Oh, sorry. I want to mute that. It's best if it goes to the piece because then there's no interference as the, as the planks on the... The bed begins to get good up and starts to get all types that you're going to interfere with your connection.

[00:53:19] Bob: That's true. I guess they get cut a little bit too when there's a piercing stuff. 

[00:53:23] Jimmy: That being said, my, my machine has a clamp, but it also has a cable that's connected directly to the machine. So my machine doesn't have to be clamped. For years, I was clamping it because I thought I needed to. Then after like.

Maybe it was about two years ago when the guys came to rebuild the table, and I said, and I went to cut, and I went to put the clamp on, and he goes, you don't need to do that. You know, I always thought I needed to do that because that's maybe some instruction I might have saw online or whatever he goes No, you don't need to because you're already grounded because you can if you want because but it's not necessary and I say, okay Let's make the cut without it and it worked fine because the machine is grounded to the table by some technical aspect of you know in the in the the Electrical belt, what is that thing called?

I think that All the electronics are in the belt that roll around on the CNC. Oh, like the drag chain? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Somewhere it's in there. He's like, oh yeah, it's already grounded. I didn't, I didn't build the table. It came built and then when he repaired it, I didn't really hang over him. So I didn't technically see and feel it.

So that's why I didn't realize it was already grounded. And it works fine. Occasionally you get like a bad cut and then you like, the machine has to read. The metal. So if you bring in painted metal or really oxidized metal, I usually keep a grinder around and I'll just grind that spot so that it reads it.

Like when you know it's going to touch down in the beginning of the G code. Occasionally. And my machine has all types of sensors that are supposed to read the non flatness and ride up and down at a consistent, and your machine probably has it too. It never works. Ever.

It'll bump into the thing because the surface of the material has to be perfectly clean, has to be able to read how far away it is at every aspect. So if you take a brand new piece of sheet steel, that's not oxidized, not, not, um, you know, it has the, the slag on it, what do you, there's like mill scale, mill scale.

If the mill scale's on it, it doesn't work. It doesn't work well. This has been my experience. People probably listening are going to say no, it works fine if you X, Y, Z. But in the beginning when I was having trouble with all that, all those, those, auto, automated. Height control stuff... 

[00:55:46] Bob: Yeah. Torch height adjustment, I think.

I have 

[00:55:48] Jimmy: it all on, on the computer screen. And I hit play and it'd bump and the torch would fall off and then I'd reset and I'd turn it all off and then it'd cut fine. And then, eventually, with all of them off it would bump and then I'd turn them all back on. So, one day, Chris Zepp was with me and I go, just try this and I turned them all on and it doesn't work.

And he'd go, oh, you know, let's just... I'd turn them all off and then it works. And then a couple of cuts later it bumps in. I'm like, oh, let's try it. We turn them all back on and then it works fine. So, the machine can't make a decision about what it really wants out of life. I just know that if the, if the metal is bent, it's going to be problematic.

So I just have these heavy, heavy, heavy weights if I can hold the sheet flat. So I'll put a heavy weight on, on, on extreme corners to get that belly out. And if there is a belly in the thing. And this is all about CNC plasma cutting now. If there is a belly in your machine, I just register that as the highest point, as if that's my zero, capiche?

So that as the torch is going around, it's making all the other cuts too far away, but it's still cut, but it makes the cut where it's the highest, will be the most beautiful cut. It might be the difference between, you know, 50, 000s versus... Yeah, 

[00:56:57] Bob: yeah. It's not a big gap. 

[00:56:58] Jimmy: Yeah. So anyway, so there's some torching.

I'll probably 

[00:57:03] Bob: have some questions for you as I get into this because I really don't know anything about it. I'm just kinda flying blind. 

[00:57:11] Jimmy: My machine has 40, 60, and 80 amps. I typically am always in 60 amps and then I just slow the cut down for thick metal and speed it up for thin metal. That's it. So I always make my G code the same.

I always have the same intensity, everything. And then when it's really thick, you slow it down on the override. You know, some machines have an override, I don't know if Mark 4 does, but you can override the inch per second to slow it really down. I always start all my cuts on G code at 100 inches per second, I think it is?

100 inches a minute. 100 inches a minute, and then I just slow it down or speed it up. 

[00:57:47] Bob: Gotcha. We'll see. I'll keep you 

[00:57:51] Jimmy: posted. I know, that machine gets a lot of good reviews, so a lot of people like that machine you have. Yeah. So, you know, I'm sure that's any little problems is just, you're getting used to how 

[00:58:02] Bob: it works.

Yeah. I mean, they've always been really avid. CNC is who we're talking about. They've always been really great with support for us and, you know, answering questions and stuff. Do you have a plan to make a video 

[00:58:13] David: when it's up and running or is it, you're 

[00:58:15] Bob: just going to use it in a project? I'm just going to use it in projects.

Yeah. I don't, I don't really think it as a standalone video of just like, look, a machine, I don't think it would be worthwhile, but. Um, yeah, I just want to use it to show people that it's something that is possible. And obviously people are not all going to go out and get a plasma table, but. It was a, for me to get the table was a big internal step for me to be like, okay, I'm going to stop trying to avoid using tools that I think would be a good solution just for accessibility.

I don't want to always be, make things that are inaccessible, but also, and I think we've talked about this before. I just don't want to be. I don't want to limit myself to things that everybody has access to, or most people have access to. You know, it's just, I have ideas, so I'm going to try 

[00:59:05] Jimmy: those ideas.

By the way, I got a Thunder Laser and I love it. Oh yeah? It's awesome. Yeah, they sent one over. I'm going to do a video for them. It's a great machine. It's the 51 inch. It's incredible. It's huge. It's humongous, 

[00:59:19] Bob: but it's like a smart 

[00:59:20] Jimmy: car. Yeah. It's like as big as a smart car. I haven't mentioned too much about this, but Rob has been doing a really bang up job over at the shop.

We went through a list of machines I have sitting around, and I probably mentioned this. We're getting rid of like 15, 20 machines that we don't use. And then we just sell it and we're putting them on Facebook market and Rob's handling all the buys and sells. We got rid of two machines yesterday. Carrier came and picked up two pallets.

Machines that just don't use. I've had them now. It's like when you look in your junk drawer and you're like, I haven't even touched this in two years. Let me get rid of it. I have these giant machines taking up like 10 square feet. I'm like, I haven't used it. Let's get rid of it. So we're really cutting the herd down really, really far.

And the reason I'm bringing that up is because my thunder laser. Came off a truck where it needed a forklift, so we put it over at that shop. So it's down the block. It's not in my backyard. And logistically we're going into summer, so it'll be fine. But when it comes to winter, I'm gonna have to probably bring it over here.

'cause of the, what kind of machines are we talking about? I'm getting rid of stapling book binding machines, like more like factory process, book binding machines. I. I have a big giant Landis sewing machine that will sew through the sole of a shoe for sewing the welt on a shoe, which I got, I literally got it for free, but I got it working and I thought Taylor would use it, but we never did.

So I'm going to get rid of that. And uh, a radial arm saw, 18 inch radial arm saw, which is something I always wanted since I was a kid. I got it and I never plugged it in and used it cause I'm just too scared I'm going to like lose my upper torso to it. Uh, like, you know, I get things that just look good on camera.

Use them one time. And then. It's time to move on. 

[01:00:57] Bob: So do you think once you start cleaning out space like that, do you think you'll continue on to actually cut down to what you use on a regular basis? We're 

[01:01:06] Jimmy: definitely going to be more discerning. Absolutely. Me and Rob made that decision. Be more discerning.

Like I don't want to take bookbinding stuff just because it's there. Because I've gone through all the bookbinding stuff now and I know what I want to use. I know there's a couple key little hand tools I need. I don't need big machines for punching holes and stuff. And you know, they're like, oh, that's cool, let me try it.

I get, I try it. I'm like, how can I put this into operation and make money with it? And then I realized, I really can't. And then it just sits there. Or some machines like I had, I got a Bostitch staple machine, which is a great machine, but it's so buggy. You can't run like 10 staples without it getting jammed.

And it's just like, it's enough for me to never touch it again. So it starts with a spool of wire and then Turns the wire into staples. It's a really interesting machine from the fifties, but again, this is so buggy. It just keeps jamming up. 

[01:01:56] Bob: You're going to have a hard time selling that one. If you tell everybody that's buggy, 

[01:01:59] Jimmy: it works.

No, no. I'm just kidding. I'm that one. And that one, we're probably going to give away because it was only a couple hundred dollars that I paid for it and in the right hands of the right person that knows how to unbug the staple machine, it's, it's not, there's nothing broken about it. It's just like, there's so many adjustments on it.

It's more fun to sell an individual poster than a bound up book. That type of thing. So I'm being, I'm going to be more discerning going forward. And frankly, I mean, I see in, I see my dad, my dad has become a bad hoarder and he's got so many tools and we're giving a lot of them away. But at this point, a lot of them are useless because my dad doesn't have room.

So all of his stuff is outside. The weather has overtaken a lot of the usefulness of drills and, and Electrical equipment and I look at that I'm like is this is what's gonna be me in 25 years I got it like pull it and get rid of stuff and so I I am a hoarder as a joke yes yes I'm a hoarder but I'm really working hard to keep that in check and I'm not buying things just to buy them and you know my old mantra was keep all your supplies at the store because you know they're gonna be there and they're gonna be organized and well kept.

You know, I'm walking through my dad's house this weekend and he's like, Oh, this is a great pile of wood. I said, Dad, throw it all away because it's pointless. What are you going to do? There's nothing in there that you need. It's all been outside too. It's all wood that's been outside. Yeah, that could be the greatest piece of oak.

Get rid of it. Just go buy a piece of oak when you need a piece of oak. It's because it's going to be smooth, clean, dry, no bugs, no nothing. Just throw it all away. But he's of that mindset where it's here now. Let's deal with it. Let's not have to go buy it again. You know, but it's a different mindset now.

So anyway, I don't want to become that. 

[01:03:45] Bob: Yeah. I mean, that's, that's a great thing to be aware of for any of us, you know, in whatever capacity, like, I know it's, it's a different thing, but if you look behind me, there's a bunch of old toys stacked up right here. I mean, I collect, I've always collected toys. I know what we've talked about this before, but these are all out because I'm going to sell them.

I'm going to get rid of them because even though I enjoy looking at some of the things and I have nostalgia about some of the things. A lot of it is just, I still have them because I still have them, not because I actually continue to look at them or enjoy them or whatever. And, you know, it's one of those things like when my kids have to go through that box of stuff, they don't care about that stuff.

And so they're just going to take it to goodwill to get rid of it, which means they're going to be getting rid of money that they don't realize. They're getting rid of things they don't realize are worth money. And so if I, at least now, sell them off for what they're worth. I can use that money to, you know, put my kids college funds or whatever, just so that it's, it's a simple thing.

Everybody's got their stuff that they hang on to for whatever reason, but it's great to be aware of, you know, reality of it, I guess. 

[01:04:54] Jimmy: And then also we have, I rent half of a storage unit, which is full of Aaron's personal belongings. His family's gone through it, taking out what they want. And me and Rob just have not confronted it.

And now yesterday or this week, beginning of this week, Rob went started going through it. I went, I spent an hour there last night going through it. And he's got 40. Top 40 bins, Tupperware bin, what do you call them? Those like rubber made bins, like maybe 40 or 50, just full of personal stuff from when he moved from San Francisco.

And it's all just like tchotchkes. It's so funny. Aaron was so similar to me. He's got like one knife. He's got 10 of them. He's got one Sharpie that he likes, like one type. He's got 20 of them. And so every box has everything in it. There isn't like one box that's, it's just like a box with, and it's so cute, you know, Aaron, he'd like get into like wanting to learn chisels.

So he'd buy a bunch of books on chisels and Japanese chisels and Japanese. So every box has got like a little bit of like, you know, this intention to learn something new in it. And, uh, so it's very, it's obviously very, uh, you know, nostalgic and. And, sad in its own way, but at the same time, there's just so much stuff that would be better in somebody else's hands.

So we're putting boxes together and during the go kart event, if anybody comes to the go kart event July 1st, we're going to have a pallet and anybody who wants any of that stuff can, can have at it. And we're taking out some of the stuff and obviously all the, you know, the personal belongings and artifacts that just keep us reminding us of him we're keeping for the shop.

So we're separating it all out, but 90 percent of it is stuff that would be best in somebody else's hands. Yeah. And, you know, and it's also intermixed with personal photos, and so we're pulling all that out. We'll give that to his family and keep some of them. The cutest thing last night, it's going to make me cry.

A child picture of Aaron when he was like six years old next to his grandfather. So it's like, it's like one of these old frames, you open it up and it's a picture of him and his picture of his grandfather, but he's like five years old. So I'm going to, I'm going to put that, I think I'm going to put that in the house.

So yeah, it's just so much stuff that his family just, I think they just gave up. They were just too emotional. There's so many little things that I'm sure they would still want. So we're pulling all that out and then I'm going to have all the stories back. Like out of those 50 bins, I'm literally going to keep one of them, but just the personal stuff and everything else is going to go.

And lots of junk, like there's like You have to use pads that don't have anything interesting in it, you know, stuff like that. It's just all gonna get tossed. It's important, although it's really difficult. It's important. Sure. 

[01:07:22] Bob: Yeah. Gotcha. Well, let's wrap this one up. I want to thank our Patreon supporters, especially one that has been supporting us for a long time, but at the top level for several weeks, and I just missed his name, Sean.

Bechner. Bechner. Sean. I just missed adding you to the list to say your name and I apologize. So I'm publicly saying your name, Sean Bechner, several times, Sean Bechner, to make up for it. Sean. Bechner. Uh, but he's just one of the people that, uh, support us over there in making it the original 

[01:07:55] Jimmy: bandsaw cowboys too.

Oh yeah? Yeah. I started the hashtag BandsawCowboy and Sean jumped in right away and Jeremy Speck and a bunch of other people. Yeah. So the BandsawCowboy crew is, uh, Dave Bauer, there's a couple, there's a bunch of us. I can't think of everybody. That's, and I, I've been, I've taken a break from the, from the Instagram stuff, but I'm gonna jump back in this very soon.

I have another series in mind I'm gonna do. Series of bandsaw cutouts. So I'm gonna do 

[01:08:28] Bob: that. Cool. Right on. Well, uh, Sean Bechner is just one of the people on the list that I want to thank. The top supporters over there are Crabtree Creative, The Weber Introdued Works, Michael Menejin, Warren Works, Stu Morrison, The New Janky Workshop, Scott Oram, Odin Leather Goods, Rich at Low End Designs, Chad's Custom Creations, Chad from ManCrafting, Works by Solo, Albers Woodworks, Corey Ward, and Sean Beckner.

Thank you. Make sure that I say Sean Beckner. But there's also other people over there like Tom Funk that help us out, that make it possible for us to do the show and we are really grateful. Everybody at every level gets the after show. Uh, I don't know what we're going to talk about today, but I'm sure we'll come up with something.

Maybe I can give a tease for my, my, uh, two and a half year long project that I was talking about. Um, it's another show after this show that only Patreon supporters get. 10, 15 minutes, 20 minutes, whatever of us just telling secret stuff. So if you want to get that. If you want to join that crew, help out the show, go to patreon.

com slash making it and help us out. We would appreciate it. Do you guys have anything to recommend? 

[01:09:40] Jimmy: Yeah, I've said it before. I'm going to say it again. Neil Pask. Check out Pask Makes. Neil's got the childlike curiosity that is just so important for any artist. And I didn't know Neil was a house painter for years and he credits me among others to starting his YouTube channel.

He 

[01:09:58] Bob: makes some really cool stuff. 

[01:09:59] Jimmy: It's great. I love that he just challenges himself and goes, let me figure out how to do that. And like then it's all about learning how to do that. Whether it's the right way or the wrong way, he gets it done. And, and there is no wrong way. You know, they say if it works, it ain't stupid.

So Neil's, it's just, and then besides that, just a sweet guy. We had a really... I think we had a surprisingly great time together, he and I and Corin, and then Derek came over and some other friends in the cast of characters came and we went over to Chris Zepp had a get together out at his house and at his workshop out in Long Island, so those guys, we all drove down together to that, so it was a lot of fun, it was a really good weekend for them.

[01:10:36] Bob: That was funny how you said that. It was like, yeah, we had a really good time, the three of us, and then Derek came over. 

[01:10:41] Jimmy: I'm just, I'm trying to, I'm remembering, I'm remembering the, uh... And 

[01:10:45] Bob: then it was like, so so, you know, cause Derek was there, but... We had a really sweet time. One thing I will say about past makes, I can think of at least two, maybe three times where I've had a good idea.

And I thought, oh, I should look this up to make sure nobody else has done it. And I looked it up and he has a better version of the idea than what I was going to make. And I've gone, dang it, well, He 

[01:11:07] Jimmy: said, I have, I have one of my little notebook dumps and he said, Oh, this is, these are some of my most recent ideas from my last trip.

And he's looking at me and he's like, So, I think I might make one of these, I just want to let you know, it's on my list too. I was like, yeah, yeah, that's cool. He's like, ah, there's another one, I think I might make this one, but it won't be the same as yours. I'm like, yeah, don't worry about it. So, he said, you can make them all, I don't care, I said, it'd be great to see you make all my ideas.

I joke with him because he sounds like Ringo. He's got a Ringo Starks, he talks like this, everything goes up with him, everything goes up with him, no question. So we were goofing around with his voice all weekend long. 

[01:11:45] David: Bob and Brad, like I mentioned earlier, and then I got one more, um, this guy named Jimmy emailed me and said, you need to check out this channel called Justin the Trees and pretty cool little channel.

He's making this map of the United States and each state he's make, he's using wood. From that state. And this is a series of videos that he's doing. So it's pretty cool. 

[01:12:10] Bob: That's pretty cool. Um, mine is actually two separate videos by different friends of mine. So I talked to a few weeks ago about my friend, Jeremy Fielding.

We've talked about him before, but, uh, he does, he's an engineer, does all sorts of really cool stuff. Well, he reached out a few months back and had this project going on. He wanted some help painting it. And it was not something that I thought I would do a great job on. But I connected him with Brian from the Smuggler's Room to do the painting because Brian is awesome at that stuff.

So the two of them both put out videos about this project working with, um, Magic Wheelchair, is that what it's called? I'm blanking on the, yeah, Magic Wheelchair. They made, instead of a wheelchair, they made a desk, a wheelchair accessible desk for this lady who was really into Doctor Who. And so. They worked with SolidWorks, they designed this crazy looking desk.

It's like, it's crazy looking. And they had to get all the parts manufactured on these gigantic resin printers in China and shipped over here. And then Jeremy did a bunch of fabrication to get the whole thing working together. And then he sent it to Colorado for Brian to paint and Brian made it look real.

And then they sent it back and Jeremy brought it. Up to Illinois, I think, and dropped it off and then came back and hung out here for a day on his way back, which was awesome to hang out. But they both have videos about their parts of it. Um, and it's just, it's a crazy looking project and they both just knocked it out of the park.

So, put links to both of those things. Both fantastic channels and a really cool project that they worked together on. 

[01:13:50] Jimmy: Smarter Every Day. Jeremy Fielding was part of the bullet, first bullet thing. Have you seen Smarter Every Day's new video where he shoots a 

[01:13:56] Bob: bullet into a bullet one yet. Yeah, Dustin told me about it.

I haven't watched it yet. 

[01:14:00] Jimmy: Yeah, Jeremy was part of the team helping with technical setup. I don't think he was in the video because I listened to it, but then I watched the very end of it. I was working, but it's an incredible video. Check it out. He shoots a bullet into another bullet. It's funny. So they explode in a minute.

In the video, he talks 

[01:14:13] David: about people taking his content and repurposing it. And so he, he put his logo on the thing. A couple days later... There it is on Reddit. Stolen. And then all the comments were like, this is what Destin was trying to say in the video. Um, it's, it's funny. It's amazing footage. 

[01:14:32] Bob: So, I know he was, I haven't watched the video yet, but, um, he, we're good friends.

And so we talk on a regular basis and he was so excited. He called me one day and was like, we did it. We hit a bullet with a bullet. I've been trying to do this for so 

[01:14:48] Jimmy: long. 

[01:14:51] Bob: Yeah. Cool. Well, um, I guess that's it for this one, unless you guys got anything else. Thanks for listening, everybody. We'll see you next time.
