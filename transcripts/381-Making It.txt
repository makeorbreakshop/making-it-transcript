381-Making It 2
===

[00:00:00] Jimmy: Oh, hey. Oh, what's up? Hey, guys. Everybody's 

[00:00:03] Bob: back. Everybody hit record and everybody just scattered and disappeared. Welcome back. We 

[00:00:09] Jimmy: came up with a good idea that the second before you hit record we both had to go get notes. Yeah. 

[00:00:14] Bob: Well, how's everybody doing? Everybody staying well? I'm doing good. 

[00:00:19] David: I'm doing good.

[00:00:21] Jimmy: Back to a hundred percent. I think I had the flu a little bit this week. Flu ish. Flu ish. But I'm good. You know me, I just ignore it completely. But it was flu ish. I went out to Total Boat and we did a Christmas Wonderland. And Jackman, thank you Paul, Paul laser cut my shop and his shop at the same time.

And then I decorated my shop. So if you guys get a chance to go check out the Total Boat Christmas Wonderland that they conceived of. And it involved a lot of their products. It was just an excuse, really. They just said they wanted an excuse to have like a Christmas hangout. So they said, let's get everyone together and make something.

It was fun. We had a really good time. I got to hang out with Derek and we went on a big garbage pick. It was fun. And then I drove... Things that bad? A friend of mine reached out to me and said, you know, there's a small town in Massachusetts, the guy is giving, he's selling, possibly giving away a lot of materials.

And I mentioned it to Derek, Derek's like, that's 30 minutes away. So we made plans, we went on Sunday. You'll see some of the pictures and stories that were on the Instagram then. So that evening I drove back to New York. That's five o'clock, I left Boston, driving back to my area, Albany, New York, and it's a 200 mile ride, three hour drive, and drove directly into a snowstorm.

I was just counting on the highway being clear enough for two tracks of a tire, and there were moments where there taillights to follow. It wasn't quite blizzard conditions, but there was a few moments there where the snow was blowing directly into the high beam, or the beams, not high beams, low beams of the headlights when I could barely see anything.

Just kinda making sure there was no taillights in front of me and just watching the railing that I was keeping a consistent parallel distance from the railing on the highway. So it was a little treacherous. So a three hour drive turned into about a six hour drive. It was fun. It was really fun. And like the timing was such that I...

Yeah, that sounds really fun. I gave, I gave the guys my, my Chevy truck, my old Chevy truck to, to put new tires on. My 2018 truck, to put tires on because I took that for the ride. And I was like, yeah, I'm going to... Boston this weekend. They're like, okay, no problem. And I kept, so the day I had to leave, I kept saying, is my car ready?

They're like, you know what? We did the oil change, but we don't have time for the tire change. If you want to take it and bring it back right after the weekend, it's like, sure, no problem. The only time I needed new tires in the last three years was the day I drove home with my old tires, but I, I made it safely.

But it was fun. It was really fun. Testing your will. It's like, can I. I could melt snow and drink snow for six hours. I'm trying to think of ways I'm going to survive once my car is in the ditch, right past the other car I just drove by that was in the ditch. Yeah, I drove past about six cars that were in the ditch.

And, you know, blinkers and flashing, several cars getting pulled out of the ditch, getting pulled off of the guardrail. So it was, uh, it was challenging. Those are the moments where you test your will. Like, just drive 30 miles an hour and don't slide. 

[00:03:28] Bob: That stuff... It wears me out. Oh, no, 

[00:03:33] Jimmy: you get home and I felt like I played a football game, you know, because my neck was tense and everything was tense from just trying to be aware and 

[00:03:43] Bob: be there.

Yeah, that like high alert. It feels like everything is on. Yeah. I mean, even, even driving at night in perfect weather gives me that feeling. And I think it's something to do with... I don't know what the eye condition is when things are, when bright lights are really flary in your eyes. There's a name for that, I don't know what it is.

Um, but I think that's always bothered me. So, when I drive at night, even in great weather, I have every headlight is like... You know, an explosion, and it has like flares sticking out, and so I'm really concentrating to kind of keep track of where the center points of all the lights are, and where the headlights actually are and stuff.

[00:04:23] Jimmy: It's a funny thing, nowadays all cars have like brights as normal headlights, and then super brights. So up here when you drive around, because it's very rural and there's no street lights, everybody's giving each other the brights. And then they give back the brights. It's like, you think my lights, your lights are bright, mine are, now these are the brights.

It's the attitude with everybody that drives past each other up here. So I never flash anybody the brights. I don't ever do that ever anymore because most of the time you're guessing, you're like is that just the regular headlights or are those the brights? And you try it and then you get blasted with the attitude.

[00:04:58] Bob: The front of your car melts from all of the light. 

[00:04:59] Jimmy: Yeah, exactly. And then up here everyone's got a giant pickup truck so it's like regular lights most likely it just happened to be pointing over your dashboard. 

[00:05:08] Bob: I remember one time I was behind... Some car and they flashed their brights at somebody coming towards both of us.

It was like big truck like that and Instead of just flashing the brights back. They did like the light bar and the fog lights Yeah, you know like they have one master switch. That's like 360 lighting and it was like in a bomb went off. It was 

[00:05:28] Jimmy: just yeah that guy drives around holding like a thumb fob Just waiting waiting waiting for like the buddy Yeah But I also, so I got back this weekend and I did, yesterday was, it was Tuesday, I started epoxy, fiberglass epoxying the bottom of the boat, which was exciting.

It was a bit of a, an emotional rush and nerve wracking and all that fun stuff, but I got one half done, cause it's a keel down the middle and the epoxy fiberglass doesn't curve over sharp edges, so I have to go up to the keel and go straight up, so I got one 90 degree bend in the fabric. Where it hits the keel and goes up and I'm going to trim it and then today I'm going to do the other side.

So what's the 

[00:06:11] Bob: very tip of that keel? It's going to 

[00:06:14] Jimmy: be, it's going to be a natural flat piece of wood. It's about, it's about three eighths of an inch wide. And I might put a steel, uh, a brass rib on it. Which is what you would do on the nose of a canoe. They sell this like three eighths inch wide half round brass.

Which I would put on there. So I'm probably going to do that, but either that or I'll just put a nice piece of like hard wood, barely thin strip, something, something to add a little accent, but I'm also going to epoxy the inside of the boat, so I'll have a clean piece from, from gunwale across the bottom to the other gunwale, so it'll all be completely sealed up.

If you understand what I mean. Yeah, so, that's good. Like I said, that fiberglass doesn't make turns very well. You have to kind of dead end it into a corner, or if you can, make a 90 degree. You really have to babysit it, because it always wants to relax the flat. It's always going to pull out of that corner.

So you have to get right at that moment where the epoxy begins to get real sticky like honey, and just keep pushing it in. So, once I get started, I had to just stay there. Took a few hours. And today I'm going to do the other side. Good stuff. 

[00:07:24] Bob: I've only tried fiberglass once and it was a kind of a disaster.

I need to find another 

[00:07:29] Jimmy: vehicle for it. Even when you have all the training, it's still a disaster. It's just, it's always a fire drill. No matter what. Epoxy on your telephone. I actually, I did the right thing this time. I wrapped my camera like, do you ever see if, if any of you guys have ever, Dave, you get a couple tattoos, you, you go to tattoo artists, they wrap everything stretch wrapped with like, uh, the cellophane.

So like everything stays somewhat sanitized. I did that with my camera last night with blue tape. I wrapped it all up with blue tape, so every time I had to touch it, I left fingerprints in the blue tape and that worked. Oh yeah, that's a good idea. Really. Well, yeah. So, because the epoxy gets on everything, it's in your eyebrow and then you go to wipe it off and you go to wipe it off with like a big glob that was on the inside of your wrist you didn't notice and then you just make it worse.

[00:08:21] David: I have a question for you, so I had an epoxy pour last week that didn't quite cure and I have one of those silicon blue mats that I was using to pour on there. Part of that proxy that didn't cure because it wasn't mixed right got onto the floor because the mat fell onto the floor So now there's this sticky part All my floor that is just been sticky for a week.

I don't know how what's a good way to remove that 

[00:08:46] Jimmy: alcohol Isopropyl isopropyl alcohol or baby powder Okay when a baby powder is a good thing to keep on hand when you're doing I do the printing press and you mean to Quickly get like globs of ink off of something I just douse it with baby powder and wipe it really hard and then the baby powder absorbs it all So anytime I'm working with anything super sticky like that, I keep AB powder on to at least get rid of the annoying sticky factor quickly, but then if you had to do clean up, you could use acetone, or you can use alcohol, isopropyl alcohol dissolves resin.

Uncured resin. 

[00:09:22] David: That's, that's good, thank you.

Cool. My turn? I had a really interesting week since, uh, since we talked last. So, a few months ago, we had the pause The podcast for a few seconds while a jet engine flew over my house I don't know if if you guys remember this but You know, we stopped. I'm like, oh a plane just flew above my house. Sorry about that turns out That's one of our listeners.

His name is Paul. I don't know his rank So sorry Paul, but he Works for and with the local, uh, Air Force Base. And he reached out to me and said, Hey, do you want a behind the scenes tour and watch, uh, like a F 16 flight takeoff plus check out where we... Build and rebuild the engines and I was like heck yes and so he's like you can you can have a few guests so we took the in laws and Kelly and my brother went and it was the most amazing I don't know what I was expecting but it blew all my expectations out of the water so we got to see I think it was 8 of them take off at, uh, just when it turned dark.

So you got to see the big flames coming out of the back of the engine. And that was super impressive. And just to see where they work on the engines and the maintenance room and all the behind the scenes stuff was just absolutely so cool. And, uh, they had a beautiful... Uh, 9 11 memorial there. I guess they were, uh, when 9 11 was happening, they were in, in the air, ready to do the, do their thing.

Yeah, um, just hearing some great stories and a lot of great behind the scenes, and it was, uh, It was just an amazing experience. So, so thank you, Paul, for that. And one of the things I, I'm pretty organized here in my shop. So I wanted to see how the government organizes their stuff. So when we were in the, in the shop, I'm like, am I allowed to open up the drawers and see all the tools?

And he's like, go ahead. And we were allowed to take photos of anything except for the cockpits, which was, which was pretty fun. And so, uh, everything is labeled, and all the tools are organized, all the parts are, everyone has a tag, or is supposed to have a tag, and, uh, it's just great to hear everybody's stories on, like, uh, How, how things work, how parachutes work, how the engines work, um, it was just a really awesome experience.

So thank you, Paul. And then, after that, I got to, or I went to, uh, Zach from ZH Fabrications has a monthly meetup down in Columbus, Ohio. And my buddy Brian, our buddy, Brian Prusa, has been trying to get me to go for a long time. And every month I have some reason why I can't go, and, and uh, I was able to make it down this month.

And that was really fun, so I got to hang out with Zach and Brian and a few other people, and watch Zach turn a railroad tie, or a railroad spike, into a gnome. So I got to see Zach do his thing, which he's just amazing at. Yeah. And then, uh... Brian let me stay at his place and then I met some friends the next day while in Columbus.

I, I saw some of the comments on Instagram and Facebook of, uh, people saying, Oh, you finally got Dave out of the house, which I thought was, was hilarious. So I had a really interesting and fun week. So a lot has happened since the last time we talked. 

[00:13:10] Bob: Yeah. Oh yeah. Well, I took a kid to soccer practice. And then another soccer practice.

That's cool, man. That sounds like a bunch of fun stuff. Yeah, yeah. Oh, cool. I did actually take a bunch of people to soccer practice this week. That's kind of where my time goes now. Um, I have been working on I've been working on the Land Cruiser a little bit more. I found a couple other little things to, to figure out.

And, trying to go back and do the maintenance on it that I don't know that the previous owner did. I think he did. He seemed like he was, like, you know, took care of things and changed all the fluids and stuff. But I'm trying to get through all that just to see, um, just to make sure that it's all done, you know.

So I've been doing that stuff. Uh, I made some floating shelves for our kitchen. Did I talk about the floating shelves already? 

[00:14:06] Jimmy: You said you were going to, you were talking about making them very sturdy? 

[00:14:09] Bob: Yeah. So, I did. And they are. But it was also a big, big pain in the butt. And, it was one of those things that, as I was making it, the first time, they um, I was like, man, this is going...

This is going really well. Like, this is, like, super fast. Like, we're going to get this whole thing done in a day, and it's fun. And then I got to putting them in the wall, and realized a mistake that I'd made that made it just way more difficult. And, just, it was stupid. And I got really frustrated, and so I had to back off for the weekend.

And then over the weekend, kind of, fresh start, just did it again. Made a very small change that made it go perfectly. It was fine, and uh, they're really strong, they're nice looking. I mean, they're very simple, it's not a complicated thing at all, but uh, it was just, it was a good lesson in you know, I, I specifically can get really just like, alright, let's go, let's just do the thing, and then It's funny because I have the two sides of it.

Sometimes I will way overthink things and not do anything for a long time because I want to think all the way through it. And sometimes I just jump in and just go without really thinking enough. And it almost always comes back to bite me. So I should know better, but I don't. Um, and it was one of those cases where I just jumped in, just should have put in ten more minutes of thinking before I did it and then I could 

[00:15:39] Jimmy: have saved it.

Can I, can I ask you, is it a secret how you did it? Can I get, can I ask you if you did it the way I'm thinking? 

[00:15:45] Bob: Tell me how you're thinking and I'll tell you if that was it. If you find 

[00:15:48] Jimmy: two studs, try and drill a hole directly into those studs and put a spike into those studs and then put that spike into the shelves.

Yeah. Yeah, oh good. Yeah. Cause 

[00:15:57] Bob: that's a sturdy, sturdy way. The thing I did wrong, or overlooked, was how necessary getting those holes, uh, completely parallel to each other. Mm hmm. And I also started with three holes across three studs. which just compounded all the difficulty. So, um, when I took the time to back off from it and think through what I did, I made a plan to make those holes perfect perfectly parallel, perpendicular to the surfaces that they were going into, which just made all the difference in the world.

[00:16:34] Jimmy: Did you make, you could have made, maybe you did, maybe you didn't, you could have made a jig? In the shop, like something that, say, might be like a 2x4, for instance, with like a big, like a 2x4 screwed to a piece of plywood so it makes it parallel and perpendicular. Then on a drill press, put your pre drilled holes in it.

So then, put that on the wall, level it, and then drill through the 2x4 on the long side. And that will keep your drill parallel and keep your holes level and in planar. . Yeah. That, that, that's would be something. 'cause when I would have to do installs in the city, I'd have to try and think through everything so they can get in there and leave as quickly as possible.

Right. And not have to come back with you Not, and not have to come back and fix stuff. So I would overthink these type of installs to the Mm-Hmm. to the max and try and come up and, and I would come up with some elegant solutions to do stuff like that. Yeah. 

[00:17:24] Bob: So it was a, you know, a, a learning weekend. How many 

[00:17:29] Jimmy: holes did you have to patch?

[00:17:31] Bob: Uh, three. Oh, there you go. The initial three that I put in, I, well, so, you know, I'm drilling into the studs, and this is like a five eighths inch hole, because I was putting in steel rods, and I wanted them to be overly strong, and that's a lot of a stud to take away. I recognize that. But you're also filling it up with steel.

So, in compression, that stud is fine. But I mean, it's not 

[00:17:55] Jimmy: gonna matter unless the house is in an earthquake. 

[00:17:58] Bob: Yeah. Anyway, so I had to go back and fill these holes with a 5 eighths inch dowel and glue to fill the void so that I would then have a surface to put the new hole back into and you know. So I ended up with two holes and it was more than enough.

Well, I couldn't do less than two holes, but it was enough. Um, so it worked out, but it was a frustrating weekend, but it was also really nice to, once I took the time to think through it. And just do it the right way, which took about the same amount of time as the original one, it was just the right way.

It went, they went right into the wall. Plenty strong, everything worked as it should. Um, another issue along the way was that, uh, as I was planing down this, this is like a 2 inch thick cherry shelf. So it's like 2 by 12 inches. 4 feet long. Big shelf. And I was planing this down, and... It got to a point where the, it just kind of like started to bog down a little bit and before I could get to the crank to back it off, to let it not bog down, it just went crazy noise wise and stopped spinning the head and it turned out that there's a urethane belt inside our, inside my planer and it melted that belt.

Oh. Yeah. Yeah. It just like fell apart because there was these big globs that just got hot enough on this little pulley and. Yeah, I don't know. Um, so I had to wait several days for that to come in, but that caused the initial shelf that I thought I was done planing, pretty much, it wasn't actually flat, it looked flat, but I didn't, in the moment of being frustrated about the planer, I didn't take the time to like, really double check to see if the shelf was flat.

So then, moving ahead without taking that moment to check that caused... Some of the un square, un levelness, you know, the whole thing. So, whatever. Anyway, I figured it out. Nothing is simple. Lesson learned. 

[00:19:58] Jimmy: Lesson is, a simple floating shelf is not simple at all. Yeah. Yeah. And I 

[00:20:03] Bob: think a big thing for me is just being, being aware in the moment to, to like, stop.

And be like, okay, let me just take a breath and double check everything. And not assume that anything is, is good enough, or is, is flat, or is square, or is whatever, you know. Check everything. So, that's something I'm gonna try to get myself in the better habit of doing. Um, but so I did that, and then we started working on the next, next video, which is really silly, and hopefully will be fun to watch, but I don't know, maybe not.

We're, uh, we're skipping this, skipping this week. To just give ourselves a little breather because because of all those troubles that that thing took longer than it was supposed to and So we're skipping this we're gonna have two more for the rest of the year So that's what we're doing 

[00:20:54] Jimmy: That's cool.

Yeah, I'm involved in a secret Santa situation For YouTube and my video will post this week. I think Sunday or Monday for my secret my Participation in the Secret Santa, and I'm still waiting on my gift. I don't know who it's coming from, but I'll get that. And so I need that little clip of me opening it up and going, Oh!

And saying thank you. 

[00:21:17] David: Oh, there's the thumbnail right there. You got chalk face. Googly eyes. 

[00:21:22] Jimmy: So I'll do home alone face. But I'm waiting on that, so I don't know. If it does, it doesn't come in on time. The coordinator of the whole event keeps checking everybody's delivery. Mine was built and sent out and got to its destination.

So now I'm waiting on mine. Do you know who it's from? I don't, and that'll be the surprise when I get the package. I know who it could be from. I know the candidates, but I don't know who. It's a secret. Gotcha. I'm hoping it's one from one particular person. Or two. 

[00:21:55] Bob: I don't think you're gonna get gifts from two people.

I don't think that's how that game works. ? 

[00:21:58] Jimmy: No. If I get one from either of those two YouTubers, I'd be very happy. Yeah, it'd be exciting. 

[00:22:05] David: I have a, so I I, we don't have a topic today, so I have a question for you two. Okay. Do you remember making anything for your folks as a kid? I made a lot 

[00:22:19] Jimmy: of stuff. In shop class or whatever.

Yeah, I made a lot of stuff for the, for the house. You know, generally, for general. I made a chess board before I understood wood movement, and now it's in pieces in the basement.

That's the first thing that comes to mind. And I was like, I made that when I was in 12th grade, a chess board, just all solid chunks all the way through, walnut and maple. And it's in like five pieces in the basement. Like my mother puts it near the workshop that I grew up in so that one day when I'm home I'll go down there and fix it.

In the Old Ghost? In the, in the Old Ghost workshop? 

[00:22:56] Bob: Yeah. Hmm. I never took shop class. Oh. So I never had the opportunity to, you know, in school or something to make a gift like that. I don't know that I made, I know when I was in college, I made a birdhouse for my mom, just like I was broke. And that was a kind of one board thing that I could make with the tools that I had on our porch at our apartment.

Is that still around? Yeah, actually they, they moved recently a couple weeks ago and I remember seeing it in the moving process. I'm like, oh, look at that. That's cool. Um, and then when I was in college, I also worked at a candle shop. Have I ever told you guys about that? I don't believe so. Oh, I worked in a candle shop, and in Savannah, there's at least two of these places, and I'm sure, you know, these other cities have them too, but we had two of them, and it's where they make the really fancy candles that have, like, lots of flowery overlay things with tons of different color.

Have you ever seen 

[00:23:56] Jimmy: these? You like slice into them and bend down the corners and stuff? 

[00:23:58] Bob: Yeah. So, I didn't do that. I did the grunt work that nobody saw in the guy's, in the owner's garage. So, I would go out to his garage and he had three or four big kilns. Um, I don't know if they call them kilns for that.

But these big wax melting vats. And then we had these aluminum or stainless steel forms that were shaped like stars. So it was like you took a star shape and you extruded it into like a 12 inch long. tapered thing. So we had a bunch of these and so I would take these like a gallon jug dip it down in this big thing of wax of molten wax and then fill up these forms that had you know like long wicks in them and everything and so I would make a batch of these candle bases or these cores and by the time I got to pouring the last one the first one was probably hard enough and I could flip it over and pop the core out.

And so I would make a few hundred of these big 12 inch cores every day. I was just sticking my hand in hot wax the whole time. It was crazy. Anyway, so that's what I did. It was not very interesting to look at, but it was when I made my mom a candle. It was the first time I got to take one of the cores and actually go to where all of the colored wax was and do the dipping.

So you take this core and then you have these vats of melted colored wax. And so you dip it in one, you pull it out, and while it's still warm, you dip it in the next one, and you just keep doing that, and you build up this shell layer of all the different colors you want. And you gotta do all this really quickly, because it has to stay soft.

And once you get it soft, then you start taking a little knife, and you start cutting in from the top down, and then you bend that piece back, and it exposes all the layers of the colors that were built up in there. So it looks really pretty very quickly once you start peeling those things back. If you know how to do it.

I didn't know how to do that. I tried it and it looked terrible. So then I ended up just taking, excuse me, I ended up just taking one of the cores, like after giving it a couple of shots, you know, the, Chuck the boss was like, yeah, I mean, you're kind of using a lot of wax now, you know. So, uh, I just took another one and just like dipped it a couple of times and it was, it was yellow.

And I'm like, cool, my mom gets a yellow candle. That's funny. 

[00:26:25] Jimmy: Throw a pine cone in there and some egg, egg corns. Yeah. 

[00:26:30] Bob: I think what I ended up doing was kind of like, um, I did a yellow base and then I kind of dipped the bottom of it in slightly more orange yellow. So it has a, like an ombre kind of outside color to it, but it's still a gradient rather than this like real ornate, you know.

[00:26:48] David: And that translated to the, you've made a couple of guitars with like a sunburst, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So. Cool. That 

[00:26:55] Bob: still sticks with you, yeah. Sure, yeah. Canvas shop was pretty cool. It was a pretty cool place to work. Um, it was a, I don't even know how I got that job. It was a very strange thing to be able to do in college.

And it was just in some 

[00:27:08] David: dude's garage? 

[00:27:10] Bob: Yeah, I mean the owner, like the shop was in the really, you know, popular string of shops in Savannah. And the people working in the shop were doing all the carving with the color stuff, so you could walk in and watch them do that carving. And then there was just a big box of these cores that I made somewhere behind the scenes.

The cool thing about that, that was the only job I've ever been fired from. Because it was my first year of college, it was the first summer in between my freshman and sophomore years where I wasn't taking any classes, I got this job, I could pay to live there, you know, so I told my parents, I'm not coming home this summer, I'm going to stay here and I'm going to work.

And... The cool thing was that the guy was like, we just need this number of cores every week. So I don't care when you come work, just take the bus out to my house on this island, work in the garage, you know, whenever you want to. Cool thing about that was I could also decide to just go to the beach for the afternoon if I wanted to.

The bad thing was that I decided to go to the beach pretty much every afternoon. And I was not getting the work done and the guy was not very... Uh, communicative. So, one day I came home from the beach or from somewhere and I had a message on my answering machine that said, Hey Bob, it's Chuck. You're fired.

Click. Oh. And like, that stuck in my head. Like, I can I can know where I was standing, I can picture the, everything. Wow. Cause that was the first time I'm like, oh wow, I totally deserve that. 

[00:28:40] Jimmy: Wow, that's harsh. Someone's gonna take that little soundbite and make it into a ringtone that we just...

[00:28:47] Bob: I did call him and clear it up and I apologized and stuff, but I was still fired, so. That's funny. 

[00:28:55] Jimmy: That's harsh. 

[00:28:56] Bob: Tell me about a time you've been fired, guys. I would love to know. 

[00:29:00] Jimmy: There was a time I quit. I got docked a day. I must have told this story somewhere along the way. It was the reason why I ended up going to college.

I was... I lived... About two blocks from the sign shop that I worked at in high school, and I would wake up one minute to eight, get my clothes together, and walk to the, you know, brush my teeth and walk to the sign shop. And I would always be there at like 8 0 1, 8 0 2, 8 0 3. And the owner's son who was in charge was a very disgruntled human being.

He would always yell at me. He'd be like, you're the closest one to the shop and you're always late. I'm like, I'm like one minute late, or right on time, or two minutes late. And so on this one particular day, uh, I had worked there all summer into the fall, he, he said, that's it, go home. The rest of you go home.

No pay for the day. And I said, alright, I quit. And he goes, you can't quit, there's a lot of work to do. I said, too late, and I ripped up my time card and I stuffed it into the time puncher. Because I had just punched. And he's like, Diresta, punch out, go home. That's it, you docked for the day. And I was like, oh really?

I quit. And I ripped my time card up and jammed it back in the thing. He goes, you can't quit, we've got a lot of work to do. I said, it's too late. And I walked out and I was like, what am I going to do now? And I went home and I sat at my kitchen table and I was like, okay, now this is a fork in the road.

And that was the day I decided to go to the School of Visual Arts. So, later that day, I was on a train, because now it was 8 in the morning, I had the whole day. Later that afternoon, I took a train to New York City, and I signed up for my first few classes at the School of Visual Arts. So, thank you, Rick, for firing me.

Not unintentionally firing me. Thanks, Rick. Because I was like in a holding pattern, I was too afraid to do anything else. Yeah. That particular day, like when he said that to me, go home, it was the first time he had been really... Everybody that was productive. There was nobody that worked at that sign shop that didn't do everything they were supposed to do or more, including me, and when I just assumed I was a cocky kid, I just assumed like, I could always take a minute or two, it was just, it was just me being a snot nosed kid, and, but it really irked him.

He also, I felt he didn't appreciate what I, you know, the value I brought. He could have been a little bit more... I don't know. Whatever. I was an idiot. It was my fault. 

[00:31:20] Bob: Yeah. 

[00:31:22] Jimmy: I could've. So now, now, now I'm always five minutes early to everything. And instead of always being one minute late. I'd rather be five minutes early than one minute late.

That's what I... And then for the last ten years, me and Taylor traveling together, she would... Casually get ready. I'm like, we got to be at the airplane. I go, she's like, we're going to be an hour early. I'm like, yeah, you want to be one minute late. You want to get there and beg them to open the door to the airplane.

I'm like, I'd rather be sitting there searching the internet waiting to get called to sit on the plane. So that's why I'd always rather be early than one minute late. 

[00:31:56] Bob: Yeah, I'm the same way. David, we never went back to your, uh, making gifts. Did you make gifts for parents or family? I've 

[00:32:03] David: got a, uh, my mom still has them.

There's two things that I remember making in, in shop class. And one was this little decorative cat that sits on a shelf and its paws hanging over the edge of the shelf. And then there's a little string, um, with a mouse attached to it. So it looks like the cat has the mouse by its tail. And, uh, I, the, the paw broke off 6, 5, 6 years ago, and I repaired it, and while I was repairing it for my mom, I, I, uh, I remade it in, into a video.

And so this, this is an older video of mine, of remaking my very first wood breaking project. So my mom still has that. And then there's this bowl that I turned on the lathe, and she puts like, um, fluffy little. Pinecones and psst sounded things in it. That's funny, 

[00:32:52] Jimmy: I made a bowl too, you reminded me, I made a bowl in high school.

It's 

[00:32:56] David: at my house. It's, it's really, it's not good. Like, I didn't do a good job of sanding it. So you can see lathe tool marks in it. And, you can tell that I either got tired of making the bowl, or I was really scared about thin walls. Because it's just so beefy. Like, the walls are 

[00:33:13] Jimmy: just so thick. Mine has thin walls at the top, and it's got like a one and a half inch thick bottom.

And it always bothered me. Because I was afraid I was going to hit the screws from the mounting plate. Yeah. I could have just put smaller screws in, but I didn't know any better. It's like a weeble, my bowl is like a weeble, like you could round the bottom and it would always face up because the whole mass is at the 

[00:33:34] David: bottom.

And I got no good stories of being fired. I've never been fired, and I always had a hard time quitting jobs. So, I've always had a hard time breaking up, getting out of relationships, and I've always had a hard time quitting jobs. I didn't want to be the bad guy. 

[00:33:52] Bob: So, I do remember You wanted to stop doing this podcast like five years ago.

Oh yeah. I just don't know how to tell you guys. I 

[00:34:00] David: worked at Kmart for over eight years. And when I got my first job out of college, which was working for a newspaper doing photo development and photo scanning, I dropped down to part time at Kmart. And so, uh, you know, I was just working evenings and weekends while working this full time job at the newspaper.

And eventually I'm like, okay, this is, and I was also working part time at a recording studio. So I had three jobs at one time and, uh, it was just too much. So I had to put in my two weeks at Kmart and my boss, she's like, I, you can't now. Yeah. You're, you're, I was a goody two shoes, so I was a pretty good employee, and she's like, you can't, we need you right now, you just can't.

So, then... How could you do this to us? Yeah, so 

[00:34:48] Bob: I didn't quit. This is Kmart! I know, I 

[00:34:51] David: kept working at Kmart, and then she quit. You can't 

[00:34:53] Jimmy: quit, and by the way, we're taking away one dollar per hour, just so you know. 

[00:34:58] David: Okay, whatever you want. And then she quit like a month later, and I was like, what? What's going on?

So then I put my two weeks back in. So, 

[00:35:07] Bob: yeah. Maybe that's why she didn't want you to quit, because she knew she was on her way out. Oh yeah, yeah. Well, um, we didn't really have a topic. I did kind of, I threw out an idea that I wasn't going to talk about, but we may as well. So, I was talking to my wife yesterday, and this time of year, I'm pretty much kind of done with most things.

I'm just tired, I'm ready for a couple, we always take off the last two weeks of the year. That's just a thing I've always done since I've been working. Um, it's just a good time to decompress for the year and stuff. And so in talking about that I'm, my brain is beginning to shut down all of the things for the year, Uh, we started talking about like, well, what's next for, you know, videos in January?

And I've been pushing off, I do have some things planned, but I've been mostly pushing off. Planning for videos and projects and stuff for next year, just because it seems so far away, but it's really not now. Especially if I'm planning on taking off a couple of weeks. And, through the conversation, we just got to talking about, like, I don't really have a whole lot of stuff that I'm thinking of that I'm really excited about doing.

And I, through the conversation, that led back to, like, all of the things that have been the impetus for ideas. So far are kind of gone, uh, you know, like the house is pretty much renovated. The, all of the big projects that are unique and new that I had thought about doing have been done. All of the shop projects that are worth, you know, making a video about have been done for me, I'm talking about my stuff and, you know, it was.

Being confronted with that, like, am I out of ideas moment, and I think, I was telling you guys, I said out loud for the first time, like, I think I am. I think I am out of ideas. The caveat to that is that, well, the caveat is, those, I am out of ideas that are generated by a certain number of, like, um, Sparks.

The house being a spark. Think of like, the house is as a renovation place. 

[00:37:34] Jimmy: So, so you're saying the house was your muse and you need more muses? Yeah, 

[00:37:36] Bob: I mean that was one of them. I think another one has been, you know, just different, different topics that are interesting. Star Wars stuff has always been kind of a muse.

It's a thing 

[00:37:46] Jimmy: that... Cosplay, you've always done good with that. And 

[00:37:49] Bob: I think a lot of those things have just, I've, I've gotten through everything associated with that. The, the Karmagea is work to be done. You know what I mean? It's not, There's a lot to do there, and there's a lot of potential content out of it, but it's, it's work to be done.

It's not like a creative... Uh, you know, like, whoa, I'm so inspired and now I want to go do that sheet metal repair that I need to do on a Karmic. You know what I mean? It's like, there's a different thing there. I do want to do that, but it's not, it's not an inspired work. And when I, through talking to her, it, it dawned on me, and I've said this before, that I don't see myself as an artist, and I know we've had that conversation a million times.

But whereas, when I, and the reason I say that is because when I think of an artist, I think of somebody who is inspired to create something that does not exist because it needs to exist. When I think of projects, they're typically to solve a problem. They're to make something happen that is currently not happening as it should or doesn't happen at all.

And so it's like a form and function kind of thing in my mind. And so when I run out of things that need function... Then I start to go like, well what is, what is the like, what do I do, what am I doing? What problem am I solving? I don't have, so I look at the whole like, problem solving thing like I think, I assume, a visual artist looks at, there's a blank canvas and the problem is that it's blank.

The solution is that it needs to look like this. And so I don't really have that. Same visual thing and so I don't know I just wanted to talk about like muses and yeah stuff I 

[00:39:34] David: I think moments like this are absolutely necessary I think the three of us the reason we are successful what we do is because we Thrive on reinventing ourselves throughout the years.

And so I think of this as like, uh, like the, the stock market, there's like ups and downs all the time, but it continually goes up over, over time. And so maybe this is like this down moment, but this is a great time, uh, I think it's necessary to feel like this so you're almost forced to come up with Bob 3.

0 or 4. 0 or wherever we're at. I feel like I am in a transitional period myself where, uh, I'm, you know, I'm trying to get rid of the how to's and just do more inspiring, creative, crazy things. And, uh, we want to start this project later this week. And, I don't have my idea, I have the base of, I'm taking a lava lamp and I want to turn it into a piece of art or a piece of fine furniture, right?

So we're starting this on Thursday, today is Wednesday, I haven't figured out exactly how I'm going to do this yet, and I tried to figure it out last night, and I think I'm going to come down to the wire tonight and start sketching and I'll come up with my idea, Right now, I currently have the feeling of, I don't have, I'm, I don't have the idea.

This sucks. We're filming tomorrow. I'm paying my brother to come over tomorrow, and I don't have the idea. And that's when I do my best work is when I'm under pressure. So this is one of those down points that's going to turn into 

[00:41:19] Jimmy: Bob 4. 0. Yeah, I definitely keep that, I definitely keep that faith that When your back's to the wall is when you come up with your best stuff.

Because it's usually for me, it's the same thing Dave just described. It's really important though to know that the only constant thing is that you're going to constantly be chasing ideas and once you have that understanding, you know, there's never going to be a free flow. Having a muse is great. Like, I, I, here's a great, this is why we started a second and we both ran and got our notebooks.

I did an idea dump last night and you can see here, there's probably... 15 ideas right there. Can you hold that up again so I can take a screenshot? Yeah, yeah, yeah, go for it. You can do all of them. No, so I mean I can go through it quickly. I want to put cemetery gates on the front of the house. I have to finish the boat.

I want to make these little metal light cages for those like fiery fake digital lights. Uh, I have to make light posts. I have to make 15 light posts along the driveway down the back. I want to make a mechanical pen. I want to come up with a new razor blade. I want to do a Carolina cutting board with the footprints.

Laser etched or inset into it. I still have to make the pool table. I have to remake a truck bed. And then there's big things like Barn Projects, because I built myself 

[00:42:26] Bob: a barn. Oh, I tell him a pool table wasn't a big thing.

[00:42:33] Jimmy: I got, I'm working, I've been working with a knife company behind the scenes to make a pocket knife. I have to make a large ceramic something. I'm making a Smithtown sign for Smithtown. I got a head, head slip cast, bathroom makeover, uh, back porch makeover. and shoe rack and that's where and then last night as I was leaving the shop walking up from the back shop to the house I'm like oh yeah and then there's that that's a big great idea when I get to my notebook I'll write it down and I got up to the house grabbed my notebook and I couldn't for the life of me remember what I wanted to write down so there's like other ideas that float around so what what helps me is constantly pulling out my phone and writing a list even when you get inspired for the slightest thing Bob like when it's like sheet metal just type sheet metal because when the initial reason you write sheet metal down is It's a patch a hole in the Karman Ghia.

But then you might be inspired to make a sheet metal bread pan. That's a tool tray. You know, just the idea, cause then when you go back to sheet metal, sometimes I play these tricks with myself, I go back, I go, sheet metal, sheet metal. I don't even remember why I wrote sheet metal. Hmm. And then you start thinking of like, you remind your future self to brainstorm off of a tab that you left.

And so it's important to, and I don't do it enough, just as I explained. It's important the minute you get inspired by something, write it in your palm or write it on the corner of an envelope. Because when you think you're going to put a little bit more power onto it, or energy, is when you realize you forgot it.

So even just those little random notes of anything, even if it's like you walk past a cool chair in the window of a shop, just stop and take a picture of it. Because then in like a month from now, when you're looking for ideas and you're looking for something, you'll see that thing and you'll go... Oh yeah, I remember I liked something about that.

You know, so it's really important to put more in so you can get more out. And, uh, you know, that's, that's really what I always say. The more input you get, just scroll through Instagram, even though scrolling sometimes seems like a waste of time, what you're really doing is implanting ideas. And, uh, where did we go?

We went, oh, we went to an antique shop over the weekend, me and Derek. We got to our garbage pick early, me, Derek, and our new friend Scott. We got to our garbage pick. Early, and so we had two hours to kill because it was in another town. Anyway, there was an antique shop, and we walked through the antique shop, and it wasn't great.

It was like a big antique mall. There wasn't any, like, groundbreaking cool stuff there, but what was there was tons of visual stimulation. And while I was walking through there, I took a couple of phone notes and those phone notes will turn into something, maybe something completely different and that's why you got to keep your mind open to be like, sheet metal is a subject that can go in a billion directions, but you also got to kind of be loose and free and be like, let me put down.

End table with lamp. Hmm, that's a good, that's a beautiful end table with a lamp. I don't want to make exactly that, but what can I make as an end table with a lamp? You know, walk through, walk through furniture, sure. Those antique malls are rich with information and Dave, you do that a lot. I 

[00:45:28] David: am, and I don't buy anything hardly ever.

You know, I'll come out with like 

[00:45:32] Jimmy: ten dollars of stuff. I never buy 

[00:45:33] David: anything. But it's just so fun. I'm wondering, so, Bob mentioned, uh, it's function over form, so, and it's problem solving. So, maybe you have to figure out a way to brainstorm problems. Like, create, maybe, this next version of Bob is creating problems to solve.

And that sounds weird, but... 

[00:45:58] Jimmy: And that is the name, that is the name of Dave Bowers podcast, by the way. Shout out. Creating Problems to Solve, and that's what he basically talks about how to make fodder for us to do what we do. 

[00:46:12] Bob: Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, that's one of the things that I kind of go back and forth on, and as I'm getting older, I'm realizing that I put all of these constraints on myself.

Like, I am this way. I like this thing, I don't like this thing. And I put all these constraints in, which then inform what I allow myself to... Pursue or not pursue. So, what I mean by that is creating problems to solve. The world has enough problems by itself. And so, then when I think about, like, actively looking, creating situations that don't exist, creating drama or, we even do this with videos.

It's like, we have the opportunity to create an unnecessary drama to make the video more enticing. And I hate that. I hate that. It makes me just, blech, makes me feel gross. 

[00:46:59] Jimmy: What do you mean, like that plot point where it's like, oh, we don't have the 

[00:47:02] Bob: material? Yeah, it's like, I know that they do that in TV.

They build those into the flow of the, you know, the ups and downs. That happens naturally sometimes to us. This last video I was talking about. Well, it happens every time. But I hate to manufacture it. And so, what I mean is I put that same feeling onto what you just said, David, where it's like, creating problems to solve.

It doesn't have to be dramatic, it doesn't have to be over the top, I know that's not what you meant. But I still put that thing in my head where I, it holds me back from doing that, you 

[00:47:31] David: know? I mean, what if you went to the antique mall, and you found something that is... Not useful anymore because of modern technology, but you modernize that.

So the problem that you're creating is taking something old and adding your spin to it, you know. Turning a gasoline powered something into an electric powered something. That sounds fun. A 

[00:47:55] Jimmy: perfect, a perfect example. This is me a couple weeks ago, so I got a message. You know, you guys, everybody knows I went through some life changes recently, which kind of...

And, uh, Side tracked me a little bit here and there and whatever, whatever, my relationship status changed, but it was difficult on coupling for all this time. And so I got a little behind in some of my obligations and one of them was Carolina's shoes. I owe them more videos than I was able to supply this year.

And so I get a message from them, they're like, Hey, let's not forget, you got these videos to do. And I was like, okay, cool. Um, and so I was in an antique shop. There's an antique, it's really more of like a high end. Antique furniture place. It's where you can find like industrial furniture for thousands of dollars.

It's a place over here in Hudson, New York, and it's called The Warehouse. Warehouse 21. If anybody knows, you can go in there and buy like a beautiful bed, but you know, of course a couple thousand dollars, but it's a beautifully preserved or restored antique, not tchotchkes, but I was walking through the place when I got that message and I was with a friend.

I'm like, oh man, I'm kind of behind in my Carolina shoe stuff. And we were walking through and, uh. And I was like, well, we're here now. I'll find an idea before we get to the end of this place. And we walked past the guy that had more Tchotchke stuff. But one of the things he had was a shoeshine box from the turn of the century, like a legit shoeshine box that somebody, you know, he was selling as an antique and it had some stuff in it.

And I was like, Hmm, we don't shine shoes, but what, you know, you sit on that. And then that led to the little shoe sit down shelf table that I just posted the reel on yesterday. But I did make a full length video. So there I went from having no ideas for Carolina shoes. To having the shoe sit down, put your shoes on, store your shoes bench, which a lot of people liked, and I emailed the file to a few friends.

Uh, right there at the moment, where I'm like, ugh, I need to come up with something. I'm not saying it's a groundbreaking idea, but it's an interesting idea that the average person could look at. And a lot of people said, that's a very useful idea, I need to make one of those for myself. And in the process of making it, I was like, it would look much cooler if it was leather.

And so in the video, I kind of take this little side path and make a leather version. But I was in the right place at the right time to come up with that idea. If I hadn't walked through that antique shop and I got that phone call while I was just in the workshop, I would have still encountered that same frustration of like, Oh, I know I have to come up with an idea.

I don't know what it's going to be, but I was in the opportunity of being, okay, let me use this environment to find this an avenue or problem to solve. And so environment is a huge, huge part of. Coming up with new stuff. You know, it's really difficult to just sit at your desk and go, Oh, I gotta come up with new stuff.

You know, the internet is there, but it is more useful to have physical, physical interaction with your space and surroundings to really get inspired. And 

[00:50:35] Bob: that was one of the things Jenny was telling me too, when we were talking about this was that, she didn't say it this way, but I, it dawned on me that, I really, like, I'm at the house, I go to the office, I don't even get out to the farm very much anymore, because of like, a car situation, and...

That's it. Like, I don't, I don't go anywhere. I don't see 

[00:50:57] Jimmy: anything. I occasionally find myself stuck in the house for a few days, and then I just go, you know what? I'm gonna go to tractor supply. I don't need anything, but I just got to go and just get out. I got to go to Home Depot. I'm gonna go buy one paintbrush at Home Depot.

I drive 25 miles to Home Depot, but it's really just to visually stimulate what's happening around 

[00:51:13] Bob: me. And I think me, me not having like a car that I'm, that I can rely on for this long has been Probably a bigger factor than I would like to admit, you know what I mean? Like not being able to just go to Home Depot and like, because I used to do that too, I'd just go and walk through the aisles and look for stuff that I've never had to look at before and Yeah, and that can be really fun and helpful.

So I think that's one thing that I want to do this coming up year is try to not necessarily take more trips because trips are good and bad and you know, but Just like try to Just to be exposed to more stuff outside of the daily rhythm. I think that's going to be a big part of, you know, getting inspiration past what I can see on a daily basis.

Um, I think the other thing is, I'm, I'm trying to figure out, I'm still trying to figure out the whole balance between, you know, I can ask somebody, like I could ask my wife for an idea, and she could give me like, I need a, I don't know, a spoon for the kitchen, like a spoon rest or something. Cool, I can do that in a day.

That's a short term project. But that solves the issue for a week. Maybe. That's not a long term, like, I need constant inspiration and, yeah, like, notebook type things. 

[00:52:28] Jimmy: You 

[00:52:29] Bob: need an idea dump. I do that, but what I'm saying is, I need to, I need to figure out a way to, you know, schedule in, like, those trips, or going to places, or something that can, that's sustainable, I guess is what I'm saying.

Not just, like, One off ideas. I would like, you know, long term inspiration things. I don't really know what it is yet But that's one of the things I'm gonna look for this year is how to build in 

[00:52:55] Jimmy: like, you know I'm gonna I'm gonna start a fire right now. Everybody go to Bob's comment section and just say one word ideas You're gonna now Bob you're gonna be forced to read them you and Megan you're gonna have to be forced to read them and you Yeah, 

[00:53:09] Bob: that's just gonna give Megan one word really 

[00:53:12] Jimmy: That one word, that one word is, that's what I needed to set off this fire.

You know, so these muses could be just one word, you 

[00:53:19] Bob: know, just write funny one words. The other big thing, and we've talked about this many times, is that I'm now at a point in this career where the, the stuff that's reasonable to do, the stuff that I'm interested in, that I want to do, that can be done in a week or a day, I've done most of it.

I know there's a bunch of other stuff that I've never done and I'm not. But for me, and so the stuff that makes me excited is, like you, you mentioned turning something gasoline into electric. That sounds awesome. And it also takes a huge amount of time and money. And so a lot of the things that I actually am inspired to do just take so much time and So, you know, like I've said before with the whole schedule thing, it's just a weird trade off of trying to figure out how to take that stuff that's really interesting and make it work over time and still do other stuff in between it to keep everything, you know, moving.

So um, that's, that's still another thing. Like, you know, we talked about, um, you guys were both looking at properties and stuff and We had considered that as well, like, well, what if we got a house that we could use as a rental property and then, you know, we could make some content around the, the, you know, renovating it or whatever.

But the investment there is so big, both from time and for money, to have something to show for it, um, I don't know, it's like hard to justify that stuff, you know, as an, almost as an experiment. It's kind of an experiment, like, it might work, it might not. I've done a lot of renovation stuff, so I'm not sure that, like, for me, that that would be the, a different enough, inspiring enough, new, long term, thing, um, that's why I haven't leaned into that one so much, but, I 

[00:55:14] Jimmy: don't know.

You got your A frame to build. That could be ten 

[00:55:18] Bob: part series. Yeah, oh, it'd be, it'd be a lot, for sure. But there again, it's, you know, I don't know, 150, in material, and then my time, which is... 

[00:55:29] Jimmy: It's only 5, 000 at a time.

Who wants to donate Bob material for his A frame? Oh, there you go, yeah. 

[00:55:37] Bob: Somebody wants to give me the material for a house? Sure, I'll take that. 

[00:55:41] Jimmy: This is gonna be a GoFundMe tonight. No, please don't do that. Don't start a GoFundMe, Bob, don't do that. But if you work on a construction site and you're in the, uh...

Start, 

[00:55:49] Bob: start dropping off extra 2x4s at my 

[00:55:51] Jimmy: house? East and Midwest, yeah, start dropping off stuff. 

[00:55:55] Bob: Yeah. Well, I think the big thing for me going into the new year is, uh, in regards to that, is trying to relax some of the, some of the self imposed constraints. I think, you know, I put a lot of constraint on my, my own creativity and what I think is...

Good content and what I think is my strength. 

[00:56:20] Jimmy: Yeah, you got to ask, you got to be honest with yourself. Not you, but all of us. We all have to be honest, because I know I do. You have to be honest with yourself and say, Why am I not pursuing this idea? It's a decent idea. Why am I not pursuing it? Because it's cold out or because I don't want to go and travel and get that material or I don't want to have to order a A sheet of eighth inch steel that's going to be too heavy to move around.

There's always one thing that holds up a decent idea, but you know the idea would be a solid video or at least a solid expression of whatever it is you want to make, whether you're a videographer or not. But, there's always that one thing you really got to be honest with yourself and say, Okay, let me confront this issue and get past it, and then the idea begins to flow, or the idea begins to come 

[00:57:03] Bob: together.

Yeah. So I think I'm going to try to loosen that stuff on myself this next year, and probably just try to make sure I'm scheduling in time every week or two to go see something I've never seen before. Just to, you know. Yeah. Whether it's local or otherwise, just to get 

[00:57:21] Jimmy: out. To bring it back to the A Frame, you know, you immediately get overwhelmed by the amount of money you will spend when it's done.

But, you know, I'm building this barn out here, this will be like a half a million dollar barn when it's done, but I don't have that much money at one time to spend. So I'm spending 10, 000, 12, 000, 10, 000, 12, 000, you know, as I go. And then I'm at a point now where I'm not doing anything. But, you know, bank accounts are just like, like calories, you gotta, you gotta spend a little bit less than you earn, you know, you gotta, you gotta just spend a little bit less than you earn.

It'll slow down once in a while, and so I'm slowing down, I'm building back up, and, you know, once the architect comes back with the plan for the walls and the siding, then, you know, I'll jump back into the pond and figure out what I need to spend, how I need to spend it, in bits and pieces. If I had all the money at once or if I decided to take out a construction loan, which I don't want to do, I would move a little bit faster, but there's no urgency at this point because it's covered.

The, the urgency was to get a good roof on it and that's, that's, now the structure is somewhat safe, but now the next, the next hurdle is to get the 

[00:58:33] Bob: walls closed. Well, and that's an interesting thing right there, too, because some people will take on a big project. Laura is taking on her house, like, start to finish as far as I can tell, I mean, that's the only thing she's done.

It's going 

[00:58:46] Jimmy: to be a whole new house, that's going to be, it's going to literally be a completely different house that looks exactly the same when she's done, but modernized. But I mean, 

[00:58:53] Bob: one approach is to, like, I'm doing this now, and I'm going to do this until it's done. The other approach is, I'm going to do a little bit of it now, and then I'm going to go do some other stuff.

I'm going to come back and do the next step. You know, and those both have, I'm sure, benefits and... You know, they have pros and cons for algorithmically and all that type of stuff, but as far as, like, workload too, like, it's exhausting to renovate a house, and man, she's gotta be just wiped out all the time, and doing a lot of work.

Yeah, 

[00:59:21] Jimmy: you need help. You need help. You're just gonna, that's why, and now, especially at my age, and anytime, I have guys doing all this for me, but I'm there helping them decide, and making decisions, and... It's, it's too labor intensive. I'll do small fun stuff, that's why I said barn projects. Lighting, doors, trim, windows, you know, stuff that's a little, you know, more digestible for, for me alone.

Yeah. Hardware, you know, blacksmith some of the hardware for some of the the various spots inside the place. Whatever. Cool. 

[00:59:57] Bob: Well, any other thoughts on, on inspiration stuff? Any other tips? 

[01:00:03] David: I think, for 

[01:00:03] Jimmy: me, free your mind and the rest will 

[01:00:05] David: follow. No, that's not, that's a inspirational right there. That sounds familiar.

Um. I think for me, I can receive all the advice in the world, but if the initial idea doesn't come from myself, I don't feel like it's, it's mine. So, uh, it's always, like, I'll take input, but I have to somehow feel like the idea is mine for it to really stick, 

[01:00:30] Jimmy: so. Yeah, you know, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta free your mind from that, because somebody around you might suggest that one thing.

You know, let's say you have that, you have that mindset of like, I don't really want your idea because I don't want to put, I don't want to mentally share it with you because then you're going to be like, Oh, how's our idea coming? And that's the worst thing, right? And uh, but to, to share ideas with people and then leapfrog from their suggestion in a brainstorm session and go, ah.

Thank you very much, you just triggered something, now I know what I want to do and it wouldn't have been there for you, so you, you played a great part, but don't come back and ask me where our idea is, because it's no longer your idea. You got me doing this other thing now. You got me on another trip, so thank you for that, and here's your two cents, have a nice day.

You know, so don't be afraid to brainstorm with somebody, because they're basically going to present you a rung of the ladder to get you to the next step. 

[01:01:22] Bob: Yeah, that's something I have a problem with too, for sure. That's another 

[01:01:26] Jimmy: one of those. Cause you're afraid, you're afraid someone's gonna spit out the idea that makes you sweat, and you're like...

[01:01:31] Bob: Yeah. Yeah, now it's not mine. I have 

[01:01:33] Jimmy: to do it the way you want! I wanted to do that, I wanted to build the Batman car. Shh! 

[01:01:41] Bob: Tell anybody I'm gonna build the Batman car. It's called the Batmobile. By the way, another Batman car. Quick, to the Batman car! Alright. Well, I want to thank our, I want to thank our Patreon supporters.

[01:02:49] Bob: a... 

[01:02:49] David: shot. Yeah, if you have a name like Petrudo, don't, don't, don't support us. We, it's hard, too hard to say. 

[01:02:56] Jimmy: Tell people. Pistachio? David Pistachio? Like the meat. 

[01:03:00] Bob: Uh, yeah. Just in case everybody doesn't already know this, I may have already said this, at one point um, when I was adding David to my phone or something, it replaced his last name with potato.

Hmm. And so for a real, I just saved it. And so for a long time you were David Potato on my phone. Oh, that's great. I don't know if I ever told you that or not. Thank you. I think I fixed it. I'm curious to see how I, I saved it. Anyway, uh, if patreon. com slash making it, you get the after show. Uh, we would greatly appreciate the support.

Is that 

[01:03:30] Jimmy: spelled right? It is, yep. Oh, wow. They must have updated 

[01:03:34] Bob: them. Yeah, I think, like, it auto updated mine to the correct... Good. I liked potato better. It's 

[01:03:41] David: funny. Kelly, uh, as a joke, I put, uh, Kelly's icon in my contacts as a hot dog. And she's a vegetarian, so every time she calls or texts me, a hot dog shows up.

And it's just, it makes me giggle every single 

[01:03:55] Jimmy: time. 

[01:03:58] Bob: Um, so big thanks to the Patreon supporters, we are really grateful for you all. You guys got anything to recommend this week? Sure! 

[01:04:08] Jimmy: You know, I'll recommend something because you just reminded me of it and it's made me laugh. If you guys don't know... 3D DIY Dave on Instagram.

Go check him out. He's very, very, very funny. And he, he has, he's the guy that did the 3D scan of me and many other people at MakerCamp. And then this weekend while we were at the TotalBoat, Dave sent an envelope and it was all of us. 3D printed at 0 scale or 0 scale. The figures are about 1 and 1 8th of an inch tall.

And in the diorama there's me, there's Dre, there's Derek, there's Paul, and a few other people are in the diorama that, that... Dave, Dave Printed, 3D DIY Dave, and Dave made, uh, he, he scanned himself and he scanned a hot dog and he put his face and arms and legs on a hot dog, so he's like a little hot dog man, which is very, nice, awesome, so, 

[01:04:59] David: check him out.

Uh, I want to, just in case I misspoke earlier, I want to thank Paul for the Air Force base tour. He is an F 16 mechanic and jet engine specialist. So, again, thank you Paul. That was just absolutely amazing. Um, My pick this week is going to be Zach from ZH Fabrications. We'll link to his Instagram. He's just an incredible artist and all around good person.

And has, uh, um, an amazing liquor cabinet. Full of, like, he's got a full bar in his house. Like, it's, it's, uh, it's, it's, it's well stocked. And it was, it was impressive. Just as impressive as his shop. So, thank you, Zach. 

[01:05:47] Bob: He's a good dude. I'm a good dude. Um, so mine is a show that I just started watching, and so I can only speak to the first episode, so, you know, like everything, who knows.

But, it's called Limitless, with Chris Hemsworth. The Thor guy. And, so, I'd heard about this show. It's on Disney but I think it's actually one of the National Geographic shows. Like, I think they did it through National Geographic. So you can watch it different places. But, the first episode, at least, I think the whole thing is about him kind of, uh, taking on health stuff and, you know, stress stuff.

And trying to, it's like a combination of doing extreme things. In the world that are visually interesting and then they're also tying it into You know like how that affects you and your mind and all this type of stuff And so I didn't watch it at first because it seemed I don't know I didn't know if it was like a self help II kind of show or if it was You know, like, all you gotta do is jump out of a plane, and then all your problems will be solved.

Like, I don't know what the intent was, so I decided to give it a shot. The first episode is about stress, and the thing I liked about it is that the setup for the show is he deals with a lot of stress in his life, and he's not great at handling it. And so they have three days and then he's going to walk on top of this.

He's going to walk across the top of this building, which is like 90 stories or some ridiculous thing up there. And so he's immediately starts stressing about having to do this thing. So the episode is about. You have three days to learn how to manage your stress. And so he has like a, a psychiatrist or some doctor there that's giving him tips and training him when you're in stressful situations, this is what's happening physiologically to your body.

This is why you get the sweats. This is why your heart rate elevates. This, you know, so she's going through the science of this is what actually is happening to you when you're stressed and this is what you can do to counteract it so that you're in control of the stress. How you handle it. And that was when I was like, Oh, okay.

So this isn't just like a, all you got to do is like, tell yourself that you can do it kind of show, or all you got to do is jump off a mountain. It's, it's telling it why it's a problem. And granted this, the situation is extreme. Yeah. He's getting on top of a building, but the show is about learning how to.

Deal with something on the way to that big event. And so it was really interesting, uh, just to hear, they kind of have some graphics of like the human body and they show, you know, when you, when you're in fight or flight, you have cortisol and adrenaline, both are released. And it does this to your blood vessels and it does this to your brain.

And if you stay at that level, this is what it does to you, to your health. And so you have to figure out how to pull that back. And it was a cool. It was a very National Geographic way to do that, and I thought it was pretty cool. And, like I said, I'm only one episode in, and I don't even think I finished that episode, honestly.

But, it seemed pretty cool, and I'm excited to see, um, you know, the rest of it, and how they, whatever the things they tackle. This first one was just about stress. I know I heard a headline or something somewhere that in one of these episodes he does like a DNA test. thing, like a genetics test. And he found that he's, uh, predisposed to some sort of, uh, Alzheimer's or something.

And so in filming this show, he actually found out something he wasn't expecting about his potential future health. And because of that, he decided to take a break from acting and pull back on his contribution to his career to make sure that he's investing in his family while he It doesn't have any of these symptoms that he may or may not end up having.

I was like, whoa. Wow, that's like pretty, that's pretty deep. You know, you go to like make a TV show and then you end up realizing that you need to kind of reevaluate some stuff in your life. That's pretty crazy. So, anyway. Wow. I think you read the future. It's an interesting show so far. Things will be different.

Give it a shot or don't. That's good. Where do you find it? Um, it's on, you can watch it on Hulu and Disney Plus and probably online somewhere. I don't really know all the places, but. So, there's that. Uh, you guys got anything else? That's it. Cool. 

[01:10:18] Jimmy: Alright, well. Free your mind. Free your mind and the rest 

[01:10:21] Bob: will follow.

Well, big thanks, uh, to everybody for listening this week. We appreciate it. Hope you're having a good holiday season. We'll probably record next week, but no promises? Probably will. We'll see. We'll see. That's good. Yeah, we'll see. Happy holidays. Well, thanks for listening, and, uh, we'll see you next time.

[01:10:41] Jimmy: Later. Love you. Bye.
