379 - Making It
===

[00:00:00] Bob: ðŸŽµ It's the yearly Thanksgiving episode with your hosts Jimmy DiResta Hello, Hi, 

[00:00:08] Jimmy: Hi, 

[00:00:09] Bob: Hi and David Picciuto Hey everybody and Bob Claggett Hey What's up? Hi 

[00:00:19] Jimmy: guys It's getting cold out By the way, I want to let everybody in the whole world know that Where I live in New York, there was no snow. It was a light dusting.

There was no snow. I got all these like, boy, you must be scooping out. How's everybody? Is, is your car covered? None. There was no snow here. I don't know where it ended, but it was mostly in Buffalo. I get five hours. Buffalo's five hours away from here. 

[00:00:44] Bob: Okay. I woke up that morning and, you know, the news was like, Western New York covered in six feet of snow, and I'm like, Oh, I better check on Jimmy.

So I sent him a text and said, Hey, you know, is everything okay? And he sends me a picture of his yard with zero snow in it. Yeah, just a 

[00:00:59] David: beautiful landscape shot, sun in the background. 

[00:01:02] Jimmy: Yeah. Tree line. But there was many, many, there was about 15 texts and messages and various platforms asking me how the snow was.

None. 

[00:01:12] Bob: Thankfully. I didn't get any either. No. Just so you know. Well, what have you been doing without snow? 

[00:01:20] Jimmy: I've been building a road. I've been showing a lot of it on Instagram. So if you guys haven't seen it, you can go check there. There is a roadway. So when we design the barn, everybody drives right through the lawn and there's a road developing across my big giant beautiful lawn.

And there's nothing I could do about it because it's the only way to get to the new barn in the back. So we made this plan about a year ago to build a road through the woods. And so talking to the guys that I try and keep busy up here because it benefits me. I have projects done. They get money. So there's this team of guys that did the roof on the barn and they're like, what do you want to do next?

I'm like, well, since we're going to do the walls, I don't want to keep driving through the yard. I go, let's, let's start that road. And so I've been showing all the excavation and. We built the ledge on the side of the building, which, so, when you look at the building that was on the TV show, when you look at the right side, there's a driveway that goes deep around the back, and on the left side, there was just a big giant hill, so there was nothing usable over there, it just went straight down, and anytime you walked on that side of the building, you were kind of fighting your way across a hill, and so we put a big ledge there, the guys put a ledge so you could drive a truck down now on the left side of the building, and then the roadway, Which kind of dips through the woods.

It has to have more of a gradual curve because we're planning on maybe having horse trailers and and different types of even propane trucks need to get back there because that's where the propane tank is for the big TV show barn and In the past the propane guys would show up, and I'd show them like a twenty twenty twenty five dollar tip And I'd be like this is yours We have to walk this hose a hundred feet that way through the rain and snow.

And they'd be like, Oh, okay, don't worry about it. We'll do it. And then I would help them because I always felt bad. But now with this new road, you can drive right up to it. And then also you could drive right up and go all the way around the TV show barn to the new horse barn. And so that's what that whole road bed is.

And people keep asking me how much do I think it's going to cost? We don't know until we go through all the truckloads of dirt. Right now we're at about 15 truckloads of dirt, maybe more. And every truckload is about 500 bucks. So that's about, I think 20 truckloads of dirt is about 10, 000. So, I mean, the road's going to cost me probably 30, 000.

Everyone keeps asking. And the good thing though with these guys is I could pay them a little bit at a time. You know, so they don't need like a big fat check because they live down the block. And they, they actually prefer me to pay them a little bit at a time. This way they don't blow all the money on one thing or another.

So, I got a good deal going with these guys. They've been very kind to me. And yesterday, Eli, one of the The truckers, he's sort of the head of the crew. He's like, take a ride with me. I'll show you where we get all the dirt. And that's why I did all that long Instagram story about me going and getting the dirt.

It's about a 20 mile ride from my house, which is a place I've never been to, which is pretty incredible. And I said, imagine owning a quarry. These type of things are like, it's like a mortuary. It's like, you don't just start that business. You get inherited that business. And like a quarry is the same thing.

And it's just, you own a piece of property, the property just happens to give up rocks that you could just sell all day long. Yeah. And they have these incredible pieces of land moving equipment and you pull in, you give the guy a thumbs up and he just dumps two or three giant scoops in the back of your truck and you drive through the scale, you get your ticket and you leave.

It's unbelievable. I mean, 

[00:04:40] Bob: it's pretty genius. Like, I'm gonna buy this field. And then I'm going to dig a hole and sell it. 

[00:04:44] Jimmy: Exactly. It's crazy. And the family that owns that owns two of them. So yesterday, if you happen to notice in yesterday's story, we went to one to get gravel, which is the thicker stuff.

And then we went to one to get the top coat, which is the finer, more like pebbles that go over that. So we went to two different quarries yesterday. They're both about 25 miles in each direction. So it's, it's great learning process. And, uh, I said it the other day. I mean, I've said it a few times now that I'm single.

I'm, I'm living this life at the moment alone. And all these projects are mine alone. And a lot of people keep asking me what I'm going to do with the horse barn. And I'm going to keep it a horse barn. Everyone thinks I'm going to turn it into like a sawmill or machine shop or whatever, but I'm going to continue to make it a horse barn.

That's what it was designed for. And there might be more horse people in my future or. Once the horse barn is done and built, I could rent it. And then the upstairs is going to be a full on second apartment on the property, which I could rent that too. And whoever rents the, let's say, for instance, I build a full apartment on the second floor of the horse barn with this new roadway, they have their full absolute separate entrance, which I would never even see them.

They would never have to pass the house because I have two driveway entrances, one that's deep around the back side of the house, and that's how you would get to all those parts of the property. So I could literally have my whole house up.

NEMA, X Carve Mine to have horses and Livestock or whatever it might be. I'm gonna continue it that way. That's how it was designed. That's how the floor is designed That's how the plumbing is designed and ultimately I think it's a good. It's a it's a good improvement on the property in general 

[00:06:30] Bob: I don't want to I didn't want to interrupt you but it's as soon as you said horse people I just imagined a bunch of centaurs walking around 

[00:06:38] Jimmy: So, 

[00:06:40] Bob: because that'd be a pretty cool future, if you could figure out how to 

[00:06:42] Jimmy: make that happen.

Yeah. Yeah. And the funny thing is yesterday, me and, uh, me and my business partner went traveling around looking at barns, we're looking to maybe, maybe get, invest in some property around here. And, but it's funny. We just drove around with a real estate broker and looked at other farms and every, we went to like three farms and they were all beautiful in their own right.

But the interesting thing is, is that. If I saw these five, say five or six barns, farms, farms in general, I would pick mine every time. The layout of mine and everything, I just, I just totally lucked out. I really got lucky. I never looked at any house. I bought this house. I looked at it. And I was like, okay, I'll take it.

And that's how spontaneous I was when I bought this house 18 years ago. And I got so lucky because now the real estate is the thing up here. Everyone's looking at all different real estate. You have all the weirdest layouts of properties because things have been handed down from families and deeds have been annexed and sold.

And you got a piece of property. That's like. You would expect it to be a big square and it's, you know, it's shaped like three States connected at a tip. You know, it's like the craziest thing. It's like, Oh, all this land is yours. Yeah. I'm like, yeah, but I got to get a driver on that guy's property and I got to look at his backyard even though I own, you know, a hundred acres and he's like right in the Island in the middle of it.

So there's lots, there's, there's lots of various things to look at up here, but like I said, I would choose mine so far over any of the things I've seen so far. So I just got lucky and it's just, I don't know how I got so lucky, but I did. But there's something, there's uh, we're getting into a little bit of real estate investing and it's going to be interesting to see where that goes.

It has a lot to do with content creation and also just property, property ownership. It's exciting, 

[00:08:18] Bob: future. Yeah, it's a good future thing for sure. We'll see where that goes. I am, when we got our farm property, I... At the time, for what we wanted it for, it was, it fit all the needs, you know, checked all the boxes and everything.

And still does, because we don't really use it for much, we don't have any particular need for a field or anything like that, most of it is wooded. But driving out there to it, I pass all of these big, rolling hill kind of farms. And I'm always thinking, like, man, it'd be, like, it'd be really cool to have something like that, where I could build an A frame.

Like up on that hill, so it's, it's really far back there and it's really beautiful versus trying to carve out a piece in the woods to put one in our property now. But then when I start looking at the cost of those big rolling hill type farms, I'm like, nope, I don't, I don't need that at all. You can't justify that kind of land unless I was going to take advantage of the land to, you know, do a crop with it or, you know, put a barn and like keep somebody's animals or something like that.

And that's not stuff I have, I have an interest in doing. Well, 

[00:09:30] Jimmy: it's, it's, but to buy a big piece of property. If you can, especially in a rural area where it's considerably cheaper, the potential is, is exciting. To look around and say like, wow, like why hasn't anybody put a building right there in the last hundred years?

Or why hasn't anybody put a driveway over here? You know, so we looked at a couple pieces of property that were very raw and needed, you know, they didn't need anything. You could just preserve it as it was, but the potential to do interesting, potentially money earning things with it in the ways of rentals or short term rentals, like an Airbnb or something like that.

It's, uh, it's interesting. Obviously, you need money and you need, we have, you know, a pool that we're trying to put together to try and get some stuff going, but it's, uh, it's exciting. 

[00:10:16] Bob: It is exciting. Well, David, what have you been up to? 

[00:10:21] David: Same thing as last week, finishing up the vanity. We got word from the contractor that they are starting Monday on the first bathroom, so that's my deadline.

I gotta be done by Monday. Which everything is done except for the drawer faces and the two cabinet doors and everything is flush with the front with like a one eighth inch gap between everything. So I'm starting middle out, starting with the two cabinet doors and then cutting everything to size out like the drawers that are on the outsides using the track saw because As you build cabinets, nothing is perfectly square, and if you want that 1 inch gap, you kind of have to cut the size.

So going through that right now, and um, I'm glad that they're coming on Monday, not only for that to be done, but I don't want to sit on this video footage for a couple months. I want to get it out. So I want to show the before and after. And then slowly working on the guitar for the guitar build off. I haven't done any...

Actual things, except just cut into some insulation foam, some test pieces on the CNC, trying to get my shapes right. And I still haven't completely decided how mine is going to work, but the deadline is coming, so I'm, I think I work best when there's pressure in deadlines, so I'm working on that. And then that's it!

About it for this week. I don't, I may not have a video come out this week. 

[00:11:51] Bob: Yeah, we're not going to have a video out this week either. We, uh, had plans and just ran out of time. I'm going to have two videos out this week. Oh. Yeah, 

[00:12:01] David: so we can all split the AdSense on that video. 

[00:12:04] Bob: That 

[00:12:05] Jimmy: sounds good. Yeah. Okay, you will each get 25 cents.

[00:12:09] David: I may have a video. I may have a video come out on my second channel. Um, I've been thinking about using that channel a lot more, but there's this cabinet that we built for our, our dining room. It's one of my favorite pieces. And it has the, I made the veneer on the front and it has like a Chevron pattern on there.

And the veneer is really thick. It's probably an eighth inch thick, maybe slightly thicker. And we use rubber cement. For to put that on there and then the normally that would work with a veneer But this veneer was so thick that after a year and a half It actually has started to come off because of the expansion and contraction The it's the the glue just wasn't strong enough for how thick this veneer was.

So On the second channel, we're gonna peel off the veneer and use the same veneer because it looks so cool because it's got some sapwood grain running through it and we're gonna do it right with a vacuum press and glue but at that time i didn't have a vacuum press and i just assumed rubber cement was was the solution and in normal situations it would but when you cut your own veneer and it's super thick sometimes that glue can overpower or sometimes that wood can overpower the bond cool 

[00:13:23] Bob: um 

[00:13:30] David: Contact cement, not rubber cement.

Is that 

[00:13:32] Jimmy: the same thing? When you say rubber cement, I'm like, you're thinking of graphic design. Yeah, yeah, 

[00:13:37] Bob: yeah. I've done a few things with, um, well, I've done a lot of things with spray adhesive over the years. Not, not in that context, but I did some stuff with spray adhesive for Tolex and things like that, and it worked really well when you do the two, you know, you spray two sides, let it dry, and then you stick together, and it seems to go forever, and then certain times I've done it.

And I don't know if it's time or heat or what, but it ends up separating and I've never understood what causes it to work sometimes and not other times, but I've gone back and pulled things apart that didn't stick and used that contact cement, um, and that stuff just, it does not let go. So it's also nastier to work with.

I mean, it really is. Yeah, using it. But, um, well, I've been working on my guitar for the great guitar build off as well. And I've got the body cut and the neck mounted or, you know, fit into place. And so I started working on the finish. Yesterday, which is nice. It's nice to be that far ahead. I am kind of dreading doing all the electronics like that.

I don't mind electronics, but guitar electronics are tedious. Like, I've done that enough. I've got a guy for that. Oh, yeah. Maybe I should ship mine to your guy. Yeah. Um, so I'm not really looking forward to that. I also thought about this yesterday. We're supposed to get these guitars to someone, right?

They're shipped. And so I assume that there's some sort of a standard case that they're supposed to fit into. You're supposed to get a 

[00:15:11] David: case. I got 

[00:15:12] Jimmy: a case. 

[00:15:13] Bob: Oh, well, good for you guys. Which is probably good because I made my blank bigger than the original blank. So, I imagine the case probably wouldn't have fit, so I need to probably talk to them about it.

[00:15:31] Jimmy: Anyway. Did you make a four neck guitar? 

[00:15:34] Bob: It's five. Five necks. Oh. One for each finger. 

[00:15:40] Jimmy: Perfect. 

[00:15:42] Bob: No, I, I changed the, like, I added to the body, so it's bigger than that original blank was, so it goes out, so it'll probably have to have a slightly different case, but anyway, I've been working on that, and, um, we are finally, finally doing a tile backsplash in our kitchen, it's been about a year since we, air quotes, finished the kitchen, and, uh, my wife and I Have trouble deciding on design things together, and we finally did so I'm about to start doing tile probably this weekend since we're We're home for Thanksgiving.

We're not traveling or anything So I think I'm gonna take one of the days to start actually doing that tile which you know I'm looking forward to having it done not looking forward doing it tiles not my favorite thing in the world But I think the big thing that we've been working on I talked about last week is our our two new products have launched They are officially available now, and we've got, you know, Orange Friday discounts if anybody's interested, and you can...

Check out our social media and get all that information. But like the push sticks are out there and the shop mats are out there and people are ordering them, which is awesome and a little bit scary. You know, it's like a whole new thing. Uh, new processes, new materials. We want it to be good quality. And so we're, it's just a little nerve wracking.

Like, I don't know. Jimmy, if you have done enough product stuff that you're just kind of like that anxiety of a new thing is gone or I mean, 

[00:17:10] Jimmy: It all, you know, when you begin to start selling something, the anxiety is there. Uh, yeah, definitely. There's always something wrong with something. 

[00:17:17] Bob: Yeah, that's what it feels like.

It feels like no matter how hard we try to like get some, a clean cut or a good packaging or like. I feel like we're gonna miss something. 

[00:17:26] Jimmy: And then there's always something. When we did the toy business and that was my primary income, and we would develop a product and it would take sometimes years, definitely at least a year.

And then eventually you'd see the product on the shelf and you'd, you'd go up to it and you'd realize there's certain aspects of a drop test or certain aspects of the way you decided to choose.

I'll give you an example. Years ago, I have the patent on this thing called Popball. It's completely expired now. This is 20 years ago. I came up with this idea just... Experimenting and tinkering. I took a ball and I was experimenting with using that ball to blow up a bubble. So it looked like a, like a figure, like a, like a mad ball was blowing a chewing gum bubble.

Right. So it had a little tiny balloon in it. Right. And then one day all the air expelled through both of them. And now when I let it go, it sucked the balloon back in the mouth, which wasn't something I anticipated. This is all just from tinkering. I was like, Oh, wow, that's cool. And then, but when I squeezed it again, the balloon popped out with a really audible snap and then I let go and it sucked back in.

So then every time I squeeze it, it would make a big, loud snap and I'd let go and it sucked back in. And it was this crazy sound and we called them pop balls. It was like pop, pop, pop, pop, pop. And that was around the same time as Gurgling Guts. So we sold pop balls. We, the company that made Gurgling Guts made.

Tens of thousands of pop balls. But one thing we didn't realize is that in the store, a kid would squeeze the ball, the balloon would pop out of the mouth, and then they would twist the balloon so that the balloon stays full of air on the shelf and people pick it up and they go, Oh, it's a ball with a little ball stuck on it.

We don't understand what this does. It says it's supposed to pop, it doesn't do anything. And that, only that, the balloon being overstretched while it's being full of air, twisted, and then just sat on the shelf for a day, three, four, five days a week, the balloon became... Overstretched and broke. So half the things on the shelf were broken from being expended, extended for extended periods of time.

And the other half were just like a balloon sticking out. So like a kid would figure this out and do it to every single one of them in the display and leave. So every toy store we went in and we found them for sale, they were only for sale for about eight minutes. Every toy store we went in, we saw that.

But that wasn't something, like I wanted to work perfect, so I wasn't thinking. I wasn't thinking. Another product we did, I'll give you another product failure. If you take a big sheet of, a big giant sheet of, uh, like polystyrene, Like 040 or 050 polystyrene and you wiggle it, it goes, it makes that thunderous wiggle.

Right? So I came up with, I would always do it in the shop and everyone, that's just the coolest sound. And then you grab it, you could do like the old metal saw with it. And he goes, So we made a thing called wobble board and we had a handle on each end with graphics. Everyone's like, is that a snowboard?

What is that? I'm like, no, no, it's a cool sound effect thing. And it'd go wobble, wobble. So we made all the prototypes out of styrene I bought from the store. And then they. That's how I told them to manufacture it and China kept sending us samples that weren't working. Like these samples aren't wobbling because it's not the right density or maybe the plastic is not extruded correctly or whatever it is.

They did not listen to our instruction in America, told them, don't use it this way. Ultimately they made the product cause we did, it was a license for somebody. They made the product and put it out and it didn't wobble. There were these wobble boards all over the stores and you just pick them up and you're like, what does this do?

It's just like you shake the plastic and it didn't make it made it very. It made almost like an accidental wobble, but it wasn't like the big intended wobble. Like you could pick it up and do like a metal saw with it and go, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah. That's how the plastic worked that I prototyped.

And that's how all the salesman samples work. Cause I prototyped all the salesman samples, but we would go to stores and there would just be a big box of plastic sleeve boards. Everyone's like, what is this? It's like, and it was all much thinner than the actual wobble boards that I made by hand. Another product failure, but you don't know it until you get out there.

[00:21:43] Bob: Did that ever get fixed? Or did they just stop selling them? 

[00:21:47] Jimmy: The product is just doomed to failure and that's that. Which is next, what's next? Because the toy business is a fashion business. It's like, okay, that's, oh, you got a wobble board that works now? Forget it. Give me a different toy. You know, they don't care.

You got a wobble board that actually wobbles? Forget it. Forget it. Move on. Give me something new. That's how it works. But those are two pretty big product failures that we had. There was others too. Well the 

[00:22:11] Bob: opposite of that, the opposite of that is not a failure and I had nothing to do with it. But there was this toy a couple years back that was like, it was from a Minions movie or something.

And it was a fart gun. And so it was this like, gun that just made fart sounds when you pulled the trigger. And so they sold this thing in the store where you could pull the trigger, obviously, because you want a kid to go in there and like, make the sound. 

[00:22:33] Jimmy: Yeah, Try Me is a very, is, is, Try Me is a double edged sword, because the products will break on the 

[00:22:37] Bob: shelf.

Well, and they put a whole bunch of them on the shelf, and I have a whole bunch of kids, so when you go to the store with four kids, and you put this really loud fart gun in all their hands, it's really loud, and it's hard to get them to stop. And so we, a few times, had to be like, okay, we're going to Target.

Don't touch the fart guns. That's hilarious. They're, you know, they're like loud. And then there was another... In the same store, there was a chicken from one of the, uh, one of the Disney movies, I, I don't know, but it's a chicken, and when you pick up the chicken, it squawks like a chicken, and it's really, really loud, and so, you know, every time you're in Target, every five minutes or so, some little kid walks down that and is like, oh, look, it's the chicken, and they just go to pick it up, and then it It explodes and super loud and the kid screams and yeah, there's a few things like that that people don't think through, I guess.

Anyway, yeah, it's with all that to say with the product stuff. Uh, it's, it's a little nerve wracking to put all this product stuff out. I'm really excited about it. I'm super thankful that people are... are buying it. I just hope that we can deliver in the way that we want to, you know, but that's, I don't know, kind of what we have going on, I guess.

Uh, we kind of had a topic last week that we didn't talk about. 

[00:24:00] Jimmy: You want to? Oh yeah, let me bring that up. That's from Roy Crum, Ryan, our friend, Crummy Welding. Let me pull up his message just so I could read exactly how he says it. That's a clever name. Yeah, that's really Roy's last name. Roy says, Roy, thank you for always listening and commenting to me.

Thank you, buddy. Podcast topic. When life throws you a curveball, how do you look at things with new eyes? Like new plans for your barn or a customer completely changes project midstream. Just a thought. Um, I could start cause we've been talking about the barn and uh, my curveball this, this fall and I became single.

We decided to go our separate ways for now, and we will remain friends, but that all takes time, of course. But now that I'm in the middle of a few projects, for instance, the office that I'm in, you guys remember this was no longer my office for the middle of the summer because it got gutted by somebody who wanted to do all types of different things to the room and make it a sun room, which is not what I ever wanted.

I always wanted it to be my office. And I said, where is my office going to go? Oh, we'll find a place for your office. Don't worry about that. I'm like, okay. Like one of the most important components of like everything we're doing is this like an afterthought, but we needed a sun room. And so there's a lot of sun in here right now, but there's also my office.

So I think we've got both things achieved. But in general, I realized I had to make this my office when it was just mine alone. And I immediately... Implored, my brother and Mike, the fireman, to help us. We all, three of us sheet rocked in here. We insulated sheet rock. Patrick came in, did the electric, and then we sheet rocked.

We did all the insulation, rather insulation. Patrick did all the electric and then we sheet rocked. And then as soon as I was done with sheet rocking, which was such a painful process for me 'cause I don't like it. I actually had to flatten the ceiling out too. Uh, the ceiling. The suspended, like this is all stuff I hate doing.

I hate doing this type of construction, but I powered through it because it was either that or having an empty construction site sitting here indefinitely. So, um. The only choice I have with all this is to, I'm going to cough, is to lean into it. I just put myself on mute to cough, is to lean into it. And that's what people keep saying, why are you doing a lot of work?

You're doing a lot of work. I said, well, I just have to lean into it because I can't sit here. That's just my personality. I can't just sit here. A, it keeps me busy because now I have a lot more free time on my hands for the moment. And I'm getting a lot of work done. So when life throws you some crazy changes, like my My status here, I'm just leaning into it.

The barn project sat kind of static because there was lots of decisions being made by somebody. Lots, lots of decisions. And you know what happens when you have a lot of decisions? You don't know which to choose. So nothing happens. And so now that it's just me, I'm like, okay, this is the direction we're going to go with that.

That's the direction we're going to go with that. And that's the direction we're going to go with that. You know, for me, I'd rather it be done than perfect. And my partner wanted everything to be perfect. So nothing got done. Because even if it got off to like a weird start. Oh, we can't do it like that. No, no, no, no, no.

I'm like, this is just the beginning. I says, you can't put the ladder there. I'm like, what are you talking about? This is the very beginning. The ladder has to go somewhere. So those types of things kept projects from moving forward. And so with, uh, with my new status, like I said, I'm just leaning into this stuff hard.

And if I look back and I'm like, Oh, I made a bad decision. I'm just going to swallow the pill and undo it and make it right. But forward momentum gives me. Energy to keep moving forward and keep making decisions and keep, you know, like I was going to, I have to, I need elevations for the barn, which we never drew.

And for the next step, we're going to do the SIP panels. They're all going to be CNC'd. So they have to be, somebody has to make a CNC pattern, which is the frame of the building. So, uh, Mike, my architect friend is going to come this Friday and he's going to start drawing the plans for the building. And then that's a big step.

Cause once we have the plans, I could, we could design where the windows are going to go, which was something we never talked about. Uh, where the doors are going to go, what the doors are going to look like, what the windows are going to look like. And so like I said, I'm just leaning into this. I don't want to like sit back and you know, do the poor me's and be like, you know, things could have been different.

Is that the other thing? It's very therapeutic for me. And then things are also getting, getting done. And I'll say one more story is the, the cups. The Big Giant Cups. I made the two other cups. Did I tell you the story about the two other cups? I made the two other cups. They were perfect and done and I sent pictures and the client goes, oh, that's not the right logo for those cups.

I'm like, you sent me a logo. He goes, oh, that email didn't have three logos in it? I go, no. That email you sent me had one logo in it and you told me you had three locations. So I made three cups for three locations. Each cup has the logo on it. He goes, oh no, each one of the locations has the same name but different logos.

It's like, well, you never told me that. And so I said, send me the logos. And I left it in his plate to give me the logos and months went by. And he finally said, I don't know how to do this. Could you please just print the logos and do it yourself? Because I asked him to send me the decals and it kind of punished him.

I'm like, okay, you know, since this was your mistake, you go and fix it. Cause for me to drive, I have to go drive to the sign shop is 35 miles away, the sign shop that I used. So I was like, well, you get them done there and you mail them to me. And eventually he sent me the logos in the email and then I just had them printed and we were going up that way anyway got the logos and so I was talking to somebody this week about And Certain jobs that do make you money and don't make you money.

I made money on the cups. It was a little frustrating. I certainly made money on the cups and the Buddha head, but it was a little frustrating and you know, going forward, I'm not gonna probably do much more with that client if he comes back with a crazy idea. I'll make sure I get all paid up front.

That's it. That's it. I will only deal with All these changes if you pay me 100 percent up front, now I have the ability to say that, but when you look at the years worth of projects, let's say you look at 12 months, 18 months worth of projects, you realize where you made a lot of money, for little work, And no money for a lot of work.

So you look at it all and you really have to look at the year. When you're looking at your work schedule through like a paper tube and you're just looking at that one thing and that's a failure and you move the tube a little bit to the other part of the workshop and you're like, oh, but that was a huge success.

You have to take it all in at once. You have to look at all of it. So there are a lot of times when life throws you a curve ball and you make no money on a job. Zero. And you're actually, it's costing you money. You have to go back and say, all right, that's why I had those three or four big wins. You want more wins than you want losers, but the losers are covered by the winners.

And you really have to kind of look at it life, look at a workshop life as a year at a time. When you look at it day by day, by day, by day, you just get that gut wrenching feeling of, I'm a failure. I'm a failure. This was a failure. This was a mistake. This person's driving me crazy. You know, the minute somebody throws you a curve ball, I'm thinking like, oh wow, okay.

But I have. A great job with this person. I had a great job with that person. I mean, literally, that's to calm me down in the phone call or in the text message chain. So, you really gotta keep the wins in the front of your brain to help keep you calm when you really get hit with a gut punch and you realize, Wow, this is costing me thousands of dollars that I didn't anticipate.

[00:31:36] Bob: Yeah, I mean, that zoom, that zoom out perspective can be really good in, in any number of situations where, you know, if you get too granular, you're focused on the, the very moment that you're in, the problem that you're having right there, it can feel like that's the only thing in the world. And if you can zoom out.

In time or in space or whatever, and look at those 

[00:31:54] Jimmy: things. I say it all the time, those are when you go to, uh, that's when you go to doctorate school. That's when you learn all the things you never wanted to learn. That's why I never went to master's program, because it's too much. When you get kicked in the gut with a project that is costing you money, and saying that's when you're learning, it's when you're getting your master's degree in business.

And that's when you just go, you know what? This is, this is, uh, you know, God's plan is, this is my learning. That's what this is. You know, you go to school on that first one with that client, for instance. So I went to school on the first one with that client, with the, with the cups and all that other stuff.

And now I know how that client dances, and now I'm going to dance accordingly if they come back to me, or not, except anything. You know, so you go to master class. Yeah, 

[00:32:39] David: the bigger the project, the bigger the curveballs, because when you start out and you're doing small things, you learn something, and you're like, okay, that's a learning lesson, I won't have to do that again, and then you move on to bigger projects, and things come that you just do not, do not see.

I don't do any client work, so I don't have any... I don't have much experience with that, but, uh, in, in individual project curve balls, I tend to overreact at first thinking this is horrible. This day is ruined. This project is ruined. And a lot of times, sometimes my brother's here. And that helps, because I don't blow up as much when somebody else is here, because it's embarrassing.

And, and then if we, if we just take a break, if we just do something else, or if we go to lunch, and a lot of times we can turn that into a really good opportunity, but it definitely does not feel like an opportunity when that curveball hits. It just... It's like everything is ruined. I had a plan for the day.

I just, I just want to, I just want to go back to bed. 

[00:33:46] Jimmy: Get it out, Dave. Get it out. 

[00:33:47] David: This is my therapy. Punch my therapy. Yeah. Where's the window? Come here. Come here, Wally. 

[00:33:52] Jimmy: He 

[00:33:54] David: looked right at 

[00:33:55] Bob: me. Yeah, so like, when my... Landcruiser, the engine blew on that in, that was in July, or June, or May, I don't know, sometime earlier in the year.

That set, uh, that set off a chain of... Just annoying, not any big problems, but just annoying things. Like, all of a sudden my daily driver, the vehicle that I really enjoy, but also need to get to work and make sure that I can go get materials and all of the stuff, um, you know, that I did on a regular basis, I kind of took for granted the fact that I had a vehicle that I could just go wherever I wanted to anytime.

And so that made it really difficult to do all of those things. Then we were sharing a vehicle. I got the other, the green Lane Cruiser, like I was talking about, I had to do a bunch of work on it to get it drivable. And then ever since it's been drivable, it's just been one thing after another. Like it'll drive for a couple of days and then I have to fix something.

It drives for a couple of days and I fix something else. And those are just a couple of the things that over the last half of this year. Uh, curveballs is a pretty good way to put it. Things keep showing up and keep derailing my plans on stuff or my momentum on stuff. And a few weeks back, I just had a really frustrating weekend of, um, looking at all the different things.

Just, just wide range of things that I wanted to do and was in the middle of doing. And I would look at all of them and just go through them one by one and be like, Well, okay, I can't do that because of this. I can't do this one. Because of so and so and I can't do this one and I got real frustrated with just there's a bunch of stuff That's out of my control But it's stopping me from moving any of these things forward and it's messing up my video schedule which is messing up my revenue which is messing up my ability not messing up my ability to pay people but my You know, the cash flow of like, pay people and then you make money, and then you pay people and you make money.

And I got really unusually irritated with how many things were in my way and out of my control. And I finally, after being grumpy and probably terrible to everybody around me all weekend, I, I... Went out in the backyard by myself and I was like, okay, I got to unload all this stuff, get it out of my head.

And I thought through everything and just kind of like set it aside. And then I spent time writing down a list of all the things that I do have control over. What can I do? What am I not? You know, we need to be in community with other people. We need to rely on other people, absolutely. But sometimes, when you can't, or when, you know, you just don't have what you need, you gotta like, look in, like, what, what can I do right now with what I have on hand?

And I needed to do that in that moment so that I could feel like I was moving forward on stuff and not just completely stuck. 

[00:36:57] Jimmy: Yeah, and that's what I'm doing also with the road and stuff. It's like, I can't do the sides, I can't do the interior, I can't do the electric, I gotta do something. There's 

[00:37:04] Bob: something you can do.

Yeah. Yeah, and so I think that was a big thing for me when I was, I kept getting this, and I'm still getting curveballs. There's still things that are showing, I mean, you know, people get sick at work, like that's no fun, but it's also nobody's fault. Um, and so, you have to figure out how to deal with those things, what to do in the moment, and for me, sitting down and making a list of the things that I have control over, the things that I can move forward, took a big load off my shoulders.

Because it didn't feel like everything was out of my control. It was like, yeah, there's a lot of stuff out of my control, but there's also some stuff right here that I can go do. And it puts some of the responsibility of being productive and being, you know, useful on me, and it stops me from trying to put that on everybody else.

You know, so and so is stopping me from doing this thing. Oh, my car is stopping me from, like, poor me. There's stuff I can control. There's stuff I can take advantage of. You know, take responsibility for it and make progress. So, if, I guess if I have any advice, that was a helpful thing for me in that moment of kind of like, self pity or frustration or whatever it was to just make that list of stuff that I could move on.

[00:38:16] Jimmy: And it helped. It's a good idea. I'll tell you, it's just, it's occurring to me because I'm kind of reliving some of the moments in my life while I'm listening. There have been moments where I really felt that gut punch. Like as a, for instance, I, I had this meet, David Welder remembers this story well. We made a headboard for a very expensive client and the decorator came into my shop to look at the headboard.

And she said, is that how it's going to look? That is way too dark. And I was like, I immediately got that gut punch and we painted it. We painted it with like, she picked the color of the stain and everything. It was stained oak and it's way too dark. And I was like, Well, I don't know what to do. It's already stained.

And she said, can you lighten it? And I remember Dave was just like rolling his eyes behind the decorator. And I was like, I can try. So I put a big rag of mineral spirits on it. I wiped the whole thing down and it started lightening it because it really wasn't completely secured dry yet. It was still like the same day I painted it.

And so we wiped, we wiped the whole thing down, but. The reason I bring up this story is that initial gut punch when you're like, Oh God, I can't believe the client's not happy. This is going to be a pain. I'm going to lose money on this one. The moment you get that gut punch, but then you go to the mindset of, okay, I'm going to go on to a masterclass on this one.

Next time I do this, I'm going to have big, broad samples, approved signatures, you know, so things can't go backwards and forwards like this. And, but the relief. The emotional, stressful relief of being like, okay, this is just a learning one. This is a learning one. When I look back at the year and this client has given me so much, this decorator has given me so much work, tens of thousands of dollars of work in that particular timeframe.

This is just another little few thousand dollar piece. All right. I'll do whatever it takes. But that initial gut punch to then, and the reason I bring that up is I remember as a kid, my dad going through experiences like that. And my dad, old school, didn't really have the experience and the tools to control his anger.

Would immediately start yelling at the client, burn bridges, scream and yell. And then I see him later apologizing. But right there when, when my client, it happened several different times in different ways, but I just remember that particular one. I was like, uh, I wanted to scream, but I didn't. I was like, well, maybe we could figure out a way to make it lighter.

All that turmoil that was going on in my head may have been said volumously by not talking at all, just listening to her and long pauses. I remember this whole conversation in the workshop. And, uh, but I think it was Dave. That's why I brought Dave into the story. Dave said, let's wipe it down with mineral spirits and see what it does.

And that's when we started. She's like, Oh, that's better. Okay. But it was a big, stinky, dirty mess, but we were able to get it to a point where everything was a little bit better. Yeah. You just, uh, it also helps to be quiet. Helps to be quiet, you know, if you're in a situation. 

[00:41:11] Bob: Yeah. That is, that is just advice in general.

Sometimes it helps to be quiet.

[00:41:19] Jimmy: Yeah, I always quote Barry, Barry Katz, he says, you know, make it undeniable, you know, you want to create holy S H I X X X moments, um, and he always says, Say as little as possible. I have a hard time doing that, but Barry always said that whenever we were in meetings, he'd be like, say as little as possible.

Don't have diarrhea of the mouth. Just say as little as possible. So I always hear Barry's telling me and my brother that advice before going into television meetings, and you know, that applies to a lot of different things. 

[00:41:54] Bob: Yeah, for sure. I'm not saying any other examples of, uh, Yeah, we're just gonna be quiet for the rest of the 

[00:42:01] Jimmy: episode.

Say as little as possible. That's funny. 

[00:42:06] Bob: Any other curveball stories, or, uh? 

[00:42:10] Jimmy: There's so many. 

[00:42:11] David: I just wish I could give myself advice on not... Totally imploding at the moment of the curveball. Like that, that, because that moment just feels so awful. 

[00:42:22] Jimmy: I have advice, and this is something that I constantly say to myself, and I might have said it here once or twice, the only thing that's consistent Is this gonna be a problem?

Right. That is the only thing that's consistent, is that there's going to be a problem. Everything seems perfect for moments at a time. And you know, my therapist accuses me of being a little doomsday, but the only thing that's consistent is that there's going to be a situation you have to solve. And you know, you can call that a problem, or you can call that a challenge, or you can call that a learning experience.

But there's always gonna be... A moment where you go, Oh, I really didn't expect this to happen, but now I have to deal with it. So if you kind of go into the shop that day, this is like a, like a, a, a zenny kind of thing where you just like, I am going, I'm willing to accept anything that comes through the door.

I'm willing to accept anything that happens on the bench. I'm willing to accept anything that comes through a text message or an email. 

[00:43:17] David: You know, you say that and, uh, I realize every once in a while, uh, Daniel will show up and I'm like, Hey, we're going to have a good day. No matter what happens, we're going to have a good day.

And for some reason, whenever I say that at the beginning of the day, we actually have a good day. Like there's something there's, there's that, that you're almost preparing yourself mentally for something to go wrong. And I think I need 

[00:43:42] Jimmy: to do that more. But what I'm saying that when you say I'm going to have a good day, you could be preparing yourself mentally to accept everything that comes your way.

Whereas if you go into the day with a bit of a grump and you're a little bit of a looking for problems, you'll find them and you'd be like, see, this is what I was talking about. Whereas if we're going to have a good day, like, Oh wow, all right, we spilled the paint. No worries. Wipe it up. I got another can.

It's a different mindset. It's, it's, it's part of that. You know, something's going to happen. It's, it's, it's just to be expected. The only consistent. thing is that there's going to be challenges. 

[00:44:15] Bob: Well, yeah, I mean, I think that goes down to, like, control, uh, for me, anyway. You know, I was talking earlier about having, just taking control of the things that you actually have control over, the stuff that's, you know, within your space.

And, I mean, that's problematic if, just by assuming that you have control over anything. This is maybe a big, bigger philosophical discussion, but You know, I, I find comfort, a lot of people find comfort in feeling like they have control over something. And the reality is, you really don't. I mean, like, there's just so many variables in every situation, in every relationship, in every physical thing that you're doing, in every material that you're working with.

There's just so many variables that real control over how something is gonna play out is kind of an illusion. And accepting that, I think, is what you're saying. Both of you are saying in different ways, it's like... I'm just gonna do my best to deal with my lack of control in a graceful way. And just be okay with the fact that things are not gonna go how I want them to go.

And deal with it anyway, you know, it doesn't mean it's going to be easy or anything, but I think setting yourself up for that, however you want to set yourself up for that is probably, probably easier, you know, um, but I know for me, a lot of people that comes down to like looking for problems, for me, I think it's about feeling like I have some level of control, which is not actually the case.

Even like in parenting. I, you know, you, like, you raise your kids to be adults, and you raise them in ways to mimic your own, uh, you raise your kids to, to try to mimic the good parts of yourself, the things that you think are good in yourself, and to improve on the parts of yourself that are not great. You want your kids to be better than you.

You want your kids to be more patient, and more graceful, and more forgiving, and more... You know, community minded than you are, but you're, you're trying to raise them in that direction, but you don't have any control over that. They are still individual people that can make their own decisions, even if they still live in your house and rely on you and all that type of stuff.

And so there's a certain level of control that you want to have as a parent, that you have to realize that you don't actually have. And so what you're trying to do is equip them. To be the person that you think they should be, but ultimately it comes down to them making their own choices, even as children, not even as adults, but even as children, they still make their own choices.

And are responsible for those choices, but as a, as a young parent, that's a really hard thing to differentiate. Because you feel like you are in control of this thing that relies on you, and that's not really the 

[00:47:02] Jimmy: case. We, we have a very funny statement in the, the rest of the family. It was something my dad actually said in a screaming tirade once when we were all little.

He said, everybody has a mind of their own. And he said it angrily, like he, he was just like, everybody's got a mind of their own. Meaning like, yes, we all make our own choices, but he wasn't happy about that. Yeah. And we always say, even Joey said it the other day, because now Joey, my brother, is dealing with his son who's 18, 19, going to college, deciding what he wants to do.

He doesn't know if he wants to stay in college or he wants to move to a media art school or, and my brother wants the best for him, being very frustrated that his son is not choosing exactly the choices he would make. And we were driving and he said, everybody's got a mind of their own. You know, it's funny, like, yeah, we all 

[00:47:54] David: do.

That's how it works. 

[00:47:55] Jimmy: That's how it works. If you get to a certain age. You don't need to ask me. But as a 

[00:47:59] Bob: parent, I mean, that's hard to, you know, accept, or to even understand, because from the very beginning, it's just like, this thing in front of me is not going to live until tomorrow if it's not up to me.

You know, like, they rely on me for every single thing, and then once you get that in your mind, and that relationship is built between you and that person, it's very easy to carry that on, that like, well, they rely on me, so they're going to become what I want, and that's just, that's just not how it works, so.

Alright, well. Any other thoughts? 

[00:48:32] Jimmy: No, that's it. No, just, uh, think of a challenge as masterclass. Yeah. That's what I'd 

[00:48:37] Bob: say. Also avoid curveballs. Yeah, I mean, I guess curveballs are... That's true. Don't play baseball if you don't like curveballs. I mean, it's all problem solving. It's just being able to separate that frustration in the moment when something doesn't go like you want and look at it as just another problem to solve.

Maybe that can be helpful. 

[00:48:56] Jimmy: The only constant is change. 

[00:48:59] Bob: There you go. Well, big Patreon supporters, who are awesome, as always. We had a new Patreon supporter this week. Uh, Mac, uh, Kelsey, I don't know if you guys 

[00:49:13] Jimmy: ever talked to Mac. I'm not sure if I met Mac, but Mac is, 

[00:49:17] Bob: um, uh, firefighter and, um, blacksmith in Chattanooga.

And we got to talking a couple years ago when I was looking for a kiln, and he had a kiln that he wasn't using. And so I was going to get it for my wife. And since then, we've talked on and off every six months or so about like... Hey, do you still want that kiln? I'm like, yeah, I'll get down to Chattanooga someday.

And I still haven't. So if you're listening, Mac, glad, thanks for the support on Patreon. And I promise we still want the kiln. That whole pandemic thing got in the way of me traveling to Chattanooga to get it, but we do want it if you still got it anyway, but he's just one of the several awesome people that support us on Patreon.

Our top supporters are Gretchen Hofer, Michael Menedjian, Warren Works, Scott Orem, Full Scheme, Full Scheme Designs, that would be a good name for a company, but it's Full Steam Designs. Thank you. Odin Leather Goods, Rich at Low End Designs, Low End Design, sorry. Fun Kiss Artistic Creations, You Can Make This Too, Chad from ManCrafting, Works by Solo, Albers Word Works.

And Cory Ward, uh, but there's a bunch of other people like Mac that help us out and everybody at every level gets the after show. Um, maybe we'll do like a Thanksgiving meal focused after show today. I don't know. We haven't 

[00:50:33] Jimmy: talked about it. A funny story. Chad, Chad is in Guatemala at a wedding. Chad from ManCrafting.

And he says, I'm at a wedding in Guatemala for a friend of a friend of a family or whatever friend. And he said, the groom is a huge fan of yours. Can we Skype later or whatever? So we Skype with, and I didn't realize it until I was in the call. We were talking in the groom. I was like, so you guys are all there for a wedding.

That's amazing. Who's getting married. And he goes, I'm getting married. So I was like, oh, congratulations. It was really nice. It was cool. That was really sweet. Awesome. Fans all over the world. Oh 

[00:51:06] Bob: yeah. That's wild. Uh, anyway, big thanks to the, the Patreon supporters like Chad, and if you wanna help us out and get the after show, you can go to patreon.com/making it.

We would very much appreciate it. You guys got anything to recommend this week? ? 

[00:51:24] David: I'll go. Uh, I'm gonna go with, uh, stumping. Nubs the other day. Put out, oh yeah, he put out a video. He's been making good content. He really has. And he's got one that's just on shellac and it's really good. I've used Shell. quite a bit just because it's so easy and about a year ago i got a hvlp gun and so i've been using that to spray lacquer and i recently discovered something every time i use lacquer i get sick or i get a terrible headache and i didn't put the two together up Until recently, and even if I, and I, I wear like the full 3M respirator, it covers my whole face and it's, uh, and you know, I don't smell it coming through the mask, but if I just open a can and I get a headache from it, and so I need to switch, uh, get away from lacquer and, uh, I'm going to Go back to start using shellac.

I have never sprayed shellac, so that's something I want to see if I can do. I was really good. I was getting really, really good results with the lacquer. I don't like the way the lacquer feels, because it feels fake, but it's really easy to apply. So I'm just gonna... Uh, use some of Stumpy's tips and go back to Schack.

[00:52:40] Bob: Schack. Yeah. Schack. 

[00:52:44] Jimmy: Uh, I'm having a hard time, you know, I'm gonna say 'cause he's coming to mind. Johnny builds everybody Go watch Johnny builds. Oh yeah, because Johnny builds is now full-time. He retired from the Oklahoma City Police Department. Maybe that's the wrong city, but he was a police officer and uh, he just retired.

To go full time YouTube, so check out Johnny Builds. He was here during Maker Camp. Sweet guy. He's leaning into it, doing a really good job. Oh, yeah, 

[00:53:09] Bob: he's a great guy. Talked to him at many events over the years. Super positive. Good dude. Um, I, I wish I had a good one. I, I don't. I just, I, I have not watched anything new or interesting lately and not because I can't find it.

I just haven't, I haven't been watching anything lately, so I apologize. The only thing I have, uh, the World Cup soccer was going on right now. As you guys, I think I've mentioned, I've gotten into soccer a lot in the last several months just because of my kids. And I really enjoy watching it, which is super weird for me to say because I've just never been into sports of any kind.

Um, but, World Cup is going on right now. It's very exciting to watch just because the stakes are really high and the play is really intense and stuff like that. And, so I guess the only recommendation I have would be there's an app where you can watch it all for free called Tubi. T U B I, um, and I was looking around for a way to watch it and, you know, you can pay for these different services and stream all the games and stuff, but on Tubi, you can watch the live game that's happening, but then they have full replays of the entire game and there's just ads at halftime, so it's not obnoxious to watch or anything.

Anyway, so if you're into soccer. That's a, that's a free way to 

[00:54:36] Jimmy: watch the world cup. And then also, I just realized I'm watching Whistling Diesel on Roman Atwood 

[00:54:41] Bob: podcast. Okay. Stop not doing me. Jimmy's like, Oh yeah, I forgot these other two. 

[00:54:49] Jimmy: Roman Atwood. I don't really, I never been a huge fan of his. I don't understand why people love him so much, but his podcast with Whistling Diesel, Whistling Diesel is the feature there.

It's the first time he's ever done an interview. So it's pretty good.
