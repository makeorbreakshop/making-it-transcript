399-Making It
===

[00:00:00] Bob: I apologize if I sound, um, congested, or if I sniffle. Spring sprung right in my face today, and man, I sneezed like 300 times before I got on this call. I 

[00:00:13] Jimmy: think, you know, I want to put like, you ever see the wire, like a wire brush ball? Do you see like the wire brush ball? I want to put one on each one of my drills and hold them into my eyes.

That's how itchy my eyes are. 

[00:00:25] Bob: That 

[00:00:26] Jimmy: sounds terrible. My eyes itch like crazy. I just spend half my day just like rubbing my eyes. 

[00:00:31] David: I was on the porch yesterday. Just, just enjoying my laptop on my lap and enjoying the nice weather and a little quick little breeze came through and I could see a rolling cloud of pollen just come right past me.

Yeah. 

[00:00:47] Jimmy: The fleet of trucks is covered with yellow powder. Your fleet of trucks. 

[00:00:54] Bob: Do you have a name for your fleet of trucks? Cause that'd be pretty awesome. 

[00:00:58] Jimmy: The Gamorian Guard, cause everything's black.

[00:01:03] David: Cool. Are all your vehicles black? I did not know that. 

[00:01:08] Jimmy: All, yeah, everything that's like not a hunk of. Clunker, you know, like the new cars are all black, Jeep, which Taylor has, is black, and the Mercedes, the new Mercedes, which was very cheap, by the way, seems very expensive, it's cheap. Goes back to a conversation we had before we started.

Very inexpensive. Uh, that's black, and my two Chevy trucks are black. I just, it's just our default color. When I see somebody driving a blue car, I think to myself, they could have picked any color, but they picked blue. That being said, I have a blue Chevy truck, but that was because I didn't feel like painting the interior door jambs and stuff.

I just kept it the color. 

[00:01:50] Bob: Well, you know, I saw a car the other day. It was a, I think it was a 4Runner, one of the new 4Runners. And it was like, it was like this emerald green. Kind of metallic, really bright green. And it was a nice looking color, but when I saw it, I thought, man, they had to have gone out of their way to get that color.

Like that's not sitting on the lot somewhere. That's like a, you pull out the swatch book and you say like, I want a special order this one right here. And they're like, okay, it's going to take nine months, but sure. We can do it. Which is. You know, cool, if you're going to pay that money, you should get the color you want for a car.

But then, after they're done with it, is a car like that, with a color that's kind of unique? Goes 

[00:02:31] Jimmy: for a high school student. Oh. First car. 

[00:02:34] Bob: Yeah, that's true. I guess, I guess it could be sold down. I think of like selling a car kind of across, you know, as a way to get something else. But I Irish high school student.

Irish people only like green cars, is what you're saying, right? 

[00:02:51] Jimmy: No, well there was the, when we bought the Jeep years ago, we were gonna, it was either black or that really, I don't know what, that dark green, that like dark metallic green that the Jeep makes. It's kind of like a modern Jeep color, which is really cool.

It's like the military green. It's like an army green, basically. With like a metallic. I really like that color. Every once in a while I think, man. To have a jeep like that would be cool. But then I look back at the 30 cars I own and I'm like, I don't need another car. 

[00:03:22] Bob: You just paint one of the ones you already have that color.

[00:03:24] Jimmy: Yeah, that's a good idea actually. Yeah. No, I just, I like black. It just seems like, just seems more timeless. Yeah. To me. Yeah. That's a good point. You know, a white car always looks like a dirty pair of shoes after a little while. Like when you go down to Miami and you see an old man that's still wearing vinyl shoes and like with a buckle on them and you think to yourself, wow, those shoes probably look good about three weeks, you know, in the time frame when they went new, but then they have cracks and dirt in the crevices.

And that's what I see when I see white cars. 

[00:03:57] Bob: Over this holiday weekend, I actually had a free day, and so I went out and was looking at the white cruiser. Did you take the engine out? No, I didn't. I took the, um, pressure washer out, and I pressure washed the white car, because it's been sitting in the driveway for almost a year now.

And had that, like, layer of mildew or, you know, that 

[00:04:17] Jimmy: kind of stuff. Yeah, acorns and true stuff. 

[00:04:20] Bob: Yeah, so I spent a long time just pressure washing the car just to get it back to like a kind of gray. You know, it's not really white anymore, but. And then I called yesterday, just update. Yeah, I called yesterday and talked to the guy.

What do you think he said? Any ideas? He said, it's 

[00:04:38] Jimmy: still outside. We're gonna do it tomorrow. 

[00:04:42] Bob: He said, they should have it this week. I'll call and find out. And I said, cool. Are you gonna call me back? He's like, oh, yeah, we'll call you back. I said, do you have my number? And he said, let me look. And then he was like, did you tell him, 

[00:04:56] Jimmy: did you tell him you have 5 million YouTube subscribers?

Sometimes you gotta flex a little bit. Tell him the power of your Google review. 

[00:05:05] David: What you should do is you should have your assistant call, and then when he gets on the phone, have the assistant transfer it over to you, just to make you look a little bit more important. 

[00:05:15] Bob: And by assistant, you mean me calling a different voice.

Yes, hold 

[00:05:19] Jimmy: for Mr. Claggett, please. Mr. Bob Claggett with 5 million YouTube subscribers, hang on please. 

[00:05:25] Bob: 5 million, a little inflated there. Then put them on hold. Yeah, well, anyway, still no car. Well. So, what are you guys up to? 

[00:05:38] Jimmy: I started my pool table, thankfully. Well, I started the official build. I went yesterday morning and got a bunch of walnut.

And I started gluing it up last night. So I did all those Instagram stories last night. So if anybody remembers, that's what time frame we're at. And today I'll continue that build. And it's going to move swiftly. And I haven't determined exactly what the bottom's going to be like. But last night after cutting all the wood and trimming it all up, I have a lot of cut offs, a lot of walnut cut offs.

And that pile of walnut cut offs... It gave me a really interesting idea on how to make the bottom. So I'm going with an industrial style, it's going to be walnut and black steel mixed together. A little bit of black architectural, uh, blacksmith elements. And so I'm excited for that. I finally got like a direction, so.

That, that's not, in the beginning I was trying to emulate stuff that's already out there and I was like, yeah, this is going to just basically kind of copy it. Like I really got to bring what people might expect me to do. And we're going to talk a little bit about audience today. I started thinking like, I got to lean into what people might expect and a little bit of steel, walnut, some blacksmith elements, just real simple, not over, not overdone.

And for me, it feels comfortable. After thinking the design through, it feels comfortable. It's not me trying to make a classic cowboy style, or like a saloon style pool table, which would take lots and lots of carving, which I might not even be capable of because it's so involved. At least not in the time frame.

I was going to CNC a lot of the scroll carving, but I'm just going to eliminate all the scroll carving because... I just don't have the time and it just doesn't feel comfortable. So I'm going to go with, again, this industrial style look. And I'm going to use up a lot of those walnut cutoffs which determine the concept that I have for the bottom.

So, yeah, it's exciting. I'm going to get that done and, uh, this week I'm going to put out the video, I've been editing it, we've been talking about that. The edit for the tractor, Rob Rojas and I restored a, we didn't need to do much, we recovered, it was in somebody's yard that had been sitting there for years, a John Deere bulldozer from 1953.

We've been showing a little bit of that on Instagram. So that's ready to go. So that video will be out this weekend. It'll be the first time I posted in almost a month because I've been moving so much. Welcome back. Thank you. You know, it feels, it's like a little, I'm a little nervous. Like I haven't done any shorts or reels or anything.

Well, my guys are doing shorts of old content, but as far as Instagram, I haven't done any reels. Every night I'm like, should I do a reel? And I try to think of something and I'm like, I might have a new idea. I'm trying to think of like a new little series to do on the band. So I might do animal profiles.

Maybe, like silhouettes, silhouettes. Oh, yeah. I was thinking about doing silhouettes of, of makers. So, everybody set me a side profile. Yep. Nope. Set me a side profile, everybody. And I will profile makers. Speaking 

[00:08:48] Bob: of silhouettes, we have this, um, this is just a tangent. But, we have these framed silhouettes in our bathroom.

This was my grandparents house, and, uh, they had these on the wall, and we just kept them, because we really like them. And there's two separate frames. One is of my grandparents, one is of my dad and his two brothers. And I guess when they were, you know, young teens or something, they went to Gatlinburg, and this probably would have been in the...

Late 50s, maybe, and there was a guy, apparently, on the street corner that was just doing paper cut silhouettes, and, um, they just had these done. But, saying that doesn't really do justice to how accurate they are. Did we already talk about this? I feel like we talked about this recently. No, but I remember seeing them at 

[00:09:38] David: your 

[00:09:39] Bob: place.

Yeah. Man, I could have sworn we had this conversation. Weird. Anyway. They're really accurate to the details of all five of those people, like knowing them, I can look at them as, yes, that's who that is. And it's just weird that somebody could do that in the moment with what I assume is probably just like an X Acto knife, you know, I mean there was no...

I've seen, 

[00:10:04] Jimmy: I've seen, I've seen guys do it with a pair of scissors. When I was a kid, there was a show called Wonderama with Bob McAllister. You guys are babies, you wouldn't remember that. But they had a guy on who could look at somebody. They always had an interesting craft people. And the guy with just a big pair of scissors, and he's just pulling the scissors, he's just a piece of black paper looking at somebody, just moving the paper.

He never like disengages the cutter the whole time the cut is making one long line. And he's spinning the paper completely 90, and 80, and 180 degrees the whole time until it's, I remember whoever he was looking at, it's incredible. It's almost like a, it's almost like a gift, you know, almost like a, like a, like the way Rain Man can count matches.

It's like one of those type of gifts. 

[00:10:52] David: When I was in either kindergarten or first grade, I remember a lady came in and did silhouettes of everybody in the class. And I don't remember how it was made. I think it was paper, but I don't remember the technique. And I remember everybody went home with a black silhouette of their head.

I don't have mine anymore. I don't know if that was a common thing that happened to other people or... Woodmore Elementary was, was just extra special. 

[00:11:20] Bob: Huh. Yeah, no, I don't remember having anything like that. It's pretty wild, though, looking at these and just thinking about how, you know, not having seen the guy do it, I just don't know how he did it, because there's, they're not very big.

I mean there's maybe three brothers heads in like a probably four or five foot four or five inch square frame and they have details like interior details like my dad has glasses and so they cut you know an inside line sharp lines where the the side piece and the down piece of the glasses are and you know it's I just don't know how they did it it's really really cool it'd be Interesting to watch somebody do that by hand at this point in the same way and see how they do it, but.

I'm going to do it 

on 

[00:12:09] Jimmy: a band saw, I think. 

[00:12:10] Bob: Yeah, that'd be cool. Do you think you have, like, I know, me personally, I wouldn't have the, uh, I don't, I don't know what you call it, like the translatability to be able to look at something and. Nope. And carry that out. Okay. Nope. 

[00:12:27] Jimmy: I'm going to photoshop it and make a line.

Oh, yeah, okay. Use my Epson printer to assist. Yeah. That makes sense. Yeah, I don't have, uh, you know, that sixth sense. I can't count matches when you throw them on the ground. 

[00:12:43] Bob: Well, some people are really good at looking at an image and even if they don't copy it, you know, or like redraw it or cut it or whatever, like point for point, they can see the thing that makes it unique and they can, they can replicate the thing, you know, the nose or the thing that makes you identify.

The original subject. And I, I don't, I see the whole thing. I don't see like the parts that, that stand out, I guess. 

[00:13:12] Jimmy: Yeah. It's funny when you see a cartoonist take somebody and they expand on their features. They see somebody like, it's just crazy. When I went to the school of visual arts and there was a big cartooning department and every, every day, every year there was shows in this one particular hallway.

And it was a caricature class and you'd see famous people drawn in like 10 different ways and every one of them was hilarious So that's my that's my dog coughing so abstract But yet it looks exactly like whoever Arnold Schwarzenegger But each one of them so individually abstracted from the reality of somebody's face But just so incredibly fun funkily in a funky way done.

Yeah, is your dog? Okay? Yeah, she's just coughing. She's okay They're just sitting here next to me on a pillow beside me. Gotcha. They're good. Chip and pepper. 

[00:14:05] Bob: David, what have you been up to? 

[00:14:07] David: Well, this morning, I just put out a video on... It's kind of like a shop tour, but it's the... We added up the price of all the tools I paid versus all the tools that were given to me.

And, I've been very nervous to put out this video because I, uh, in the video I have a little ticker, uh, paid vs. given, and I had no idea that the given was so much. Um. 

[00:14:35] Jimmy: Don't forget, anybody could have that, you just gotta start a YouTube 

[00:14:38] David: channel. So it was, it was interesting. So that video just went out this morning, so I'm very curious to see what the comments are.

[00:14:46] Jimmy: I'll read you a couple right now, hang 

[00:14:48] David: on. I'd rather not, I'd rather keep my spirits up. 

[00:14:51] Jimmy: And so, 

[00:14:55] David: uh, we also. We did another one of the silly videos where I bought every atom Facebook and then those products come in and we review and we just shot another one of those which are always fun because there's always Uh, you see these horrible cheap advertisements for these products and sometimes they're good and a lot, sometimes the good ones I find out are rip offs of other companies.

Um, so there's this corner clamp in this particular one, which is a direct rip off of Craig. In previous videos, there were some jigs that were good, but they were a direct rip off of woodpeckers. Sometimes I realize that they're rip offs, and sometimes the commenters will let me know that they're rip offs, so it's been interesting.

And then, um, we made some candy dishes. I went to we have a Uh, Libby Glass is here in Toledo. They're a huge glass maker of glassware and bowls and dishes and all kinds of stuff. And they have an outlet store and you can get glass so cheap here in Toledo. Like if you go to the outlet store, you can get a, uh, heavy duty glasses and dishes are like a dollar a piece.

That's like, they're so cheap where you buy them on Amazon and you buy a set and it's like 40 bucks. So we went and I got a few of those dishes. That I wanted to make wood lids for so draw the pattern like draw the pattern on a wood rough cut it out on the bandsaw double sided tape it to the glass dish use a pattern bit on the router to make the lid and then use a rabbeting bit to so it insets inside and just made a quick little video of like You don't need a lot of tools to, and you don't have to be super creative to make something that's kind of cool.

So shot one of those and I think it'll be a, uh, it'll be a very short quick video. And then there's some bigger projects in the works, but I haven't figured out how to shoot them yet. Like I'm trying, like I'm trying to get away from just like the, like, here's a, here's a build video. Step by step, beginning, middle, end.

Like, I feel like there needs to be some stakes. Like, I'm trying to find an art show or something where there's a deadline to help me to give the video a little bit more, you know. And, uh, so before I start the one project, I want to, I want to add some stakes to it. And I think it would be just a little bit more fun, a little bit more challenging for me and trying, just trying to get a little bit more creative in the storytelling.

So I'm putting a little more thought into the idea process. 

[00:17:44] Bob: Yeah, yeah, we, um, had a really long conversation at the office yesterday, um, Josh has been doing, like, a whole bunch of, um, analytic work, like, looking back at our analytics and comparing things and, you know, trying to, like, just have some data that we can look at.

Um, but that spawned a whole conversation about, about building in a story idea. And how we are at the same time right now are trying to figure out, we're making a bunch of decisions before making a video. And we're also trying to make a bunch of decisions after making the video about the title and thumbnail.

And there are two like really big processes to try to think through. And then in conversation yesterday, realizing that both of those... are affecting each other. Like if you, if you kill an idea at the very beginning, because you don't know where the story is, then you don't let the story become. And then sometimes you can use the title and thumbnail as a way to, to like help that story come out.

But if you just go into making whatever video you want to make, and then you rely only on the Title and thumbnail to do all the work of getting somebody interested in like you're kind of hamstringing yourself, you know So it's it's I don't know interesting we spent a lot of time talking about that particular thing about the How to find the story in something that wants to be made or something.

I want to make you know, like yeah Take it past just wanting to make it. 

[00:19:26] David: Yeah, for those of you who don't know, like, YouTube shows you how long people watch the video. So you get to see, like, when people are dropping off. And, like, you might have the best thumbnail in the world, and you get, um, you know, a million people clicking through, but if they don't they only watch the first couple minutes, there's something wrong with the video.

So, like, it's very focused on, on Satisfaction. So, you know, I'm always trying to think of more interesting ways to do a typical build video to make it a little bit more... And I kind of like the idea of trying to add a story to a project to, or a reason to do something. Like I see a lot of Jimmy's projects and there's a reason why he's building these things.

He, he needs this particular thing. And I look at a lot of my past projects and there's not really a reason to make another cutting board. There's not a reason that I'm making it like, let's make it a little bit more interesting. For myself and for the viewers. 

[00:20:25] Bob: Okay, so I want to probe on that for a second, because that's, that's really interesting to me.

So when I think of Jimmy, and I think of me, I think of a lot of times we make the things that are, like, we have a particular use for, or it's, you know, there's some thing that has spawned the idea. But a lot of your stuff is, is, from my perspective, it feels like art for the sake of art, which is valuable in an entirely different way.

I agree 

[00:20:52] Jimmy: with that, yeah. I like the exploratory nature of a lot of your work, Dave. You're constantly exploring and trying to figure out more about yourself as an artist, which I think is really 

[00:21:02] Bob: valuable. Do you think that trying to have a reason for all of those things might hamper some of the just creative, like, just because ness?

[00:21:11] David: No, no, not, I don't think it will hamper the creative process at all. I think it's, um, how do I put this? If I, if I make something that is for the sake of its beauty, and I know, and I plan it all out, and I film the whole thing, and I know how it's going to come out, what's the challenge in that for me? You know?

I already know how it's going to be. So if I challenge myself to have a, a, a purpose. Oh, or a reason or if there's an unknown in there, it, it just makes it a little bit more interesting to me. I'm a little bit more excited about the thing that I'm doing. Like I, I want there to be an unknown to me. I want there or there to be a deadline or something just, just so I'm a little bit more excited during the project.

And when I, like you, you see. Watch Mark Rober. Like, he's so excited about what he's doing. He's, there's a, um, he's teaching, but there's always this, this, this big ending. Like, there's this, this, this reveal, or, um, I just want to add the excitement for myself. So I continue to enjoy what I'm doing. 

[00:22:33] Bob: Cool. Yeah, that makes 

[00:22:33] David: sense.

If I'm not pushing myself, I'm not, I'm gonna get 

[00:22:37] Jimmy: very bored. Here's a suggestion, because I live the life, make something for somebody else. And make them pay you thousands of dollars for it, so this way the pressure is 50 times more. Funny, 

[00:22:47] David: funny thing about that. In my, uh, I have this little series where I go to the thrift store and I take something and I transform it.

I got a school desk that I took and I completely restored it. I put it up on Facebook Marketplace. It is not sold, like I put it up for, and the idea was I would take the money from that project and that would be the budget for the next project and then just move on down the line. I put it up at 200, it was there for a week, it did not sell, uh, so now it's at 150.

And I'm like, ah, no, no, no bites on this at all. But also... Since we're 

[00:23:25] Jimmy: talking about our audience, why wouldn't you try and offer it to the audience itself? It feels... Is there a, is there a psychological hold up there? 

[00:23:33] David: Yeah, for sure. I mean, first of all, it feels like cheating. If I said, Hey, this is for sale on my website.

Yeah. Also, it's a big school. I can't ship this thing without building a crate for it. I ain't 

[00:23:45] Jimmy: got time to build a crate. I ain't got time for that. Local pickup. There's got to be someone in Toledo that likes you. Yeah. 

[00:23:54] David: It's possible. 

[00:23:55] Bob: I mean, let's hope, but, you know. 

[00:23:57] Jimmy: Yeah. Or at least a 300 miles to conference, you know, whatever, three hour, three hour.

Well, here's the 

[00:24:05] David: thing. I just announced it here on the podcast. So, as Bob pointed out, we get a quarter of a million listeners every month on the podcast. So, this has just gone out to a whole bunch of people. Maybe one of you live in Toledo. 

[00:24:23] Jimmy: Speaking of. I wouldn't feel any shame whatsoever because people support you and they want to support you.

Yeah. Yeah, I do understand. It's a beautiful thing. 

[00:24:31] Bob: David, I do understand the impulse. Like, the thing that you're pushing back against in doing that, I do understand that. I would feel the same thing. But, I think you also, in deciding that you are an artist and going that direction, you have to... I would think you would have to realize that people who like you as an artist, you, uh, like the things that you make, would want the opportunity to be able to buy a piece of your art directly from you.

And that's an entirely different thing than what I do, and what I would do with the things that I make. But I also don't put myself in that same category, and I don't think of myself in the same way, but you do, for good reason. And I think selling your art to the people who like you as an artist is one of those things that you're probably going to have to get comfortable with.

You know what I mean? If that's the direction that you are moving, even though I can say that as someone who would absolutely not be comfortable with it. I get it. But yeah, it seems, that seems like a logical place to be able to... I don't want to say unload that thing, but you know what I mean, like, to reinvest it.

Yeah. Whatever. That works. There's 

[00:25:45] David: uh, there's also the, the struggle, I took a, I took a old school desk, and then I refinished, or I redid all the wood. All the wood is new. I had some fun doing it because there are some big curves in there and I had to use some bent ply, bent lamination and for me it was a whole process but when I look at the beginning or the before and after photos I'm like there was not much of a transformation there.

There's a reason this video just did average because it didn't, what's, there's nothing remarkable about it. That's a word that I've been enjoying. That's what makes me a 

[00:26:24] Jimmy: little nervous about doing car videos because it's remarkable. I believe people are interested in seeing on my channel, like, a pile of material become something else.

Or something. But when I do a car restoration video, it starts out as a car and ends up as a car. Yeah. Yeah. A little bit more cleaner. But, you know, we try and solve all the problems. Yeah. And that's what makes me a little nervous about doing, like, the tractor video that we're about to put out. But it is what it is.

It's still going to be informative to 20, 000 people. And that's all that matters. 

[00:26:52] Bob: Well, I think... 

[00:26:53] Jimmy: I'm joking. That's all I'm going to get is 20, 

[00:26:55] Bob: 000 people. Well, that's a good... Point though, like, and I did want to kind of talk about audience today, and I think that would lead to it. I haven't really done anything super interesting over the last week.

Nothing of note, so I'm not gonna interrupt this with what I did, but basically we, um, in, in talking to Josh doing all this research and going through analytics, one of the interesting things in there is that YouTube will tell you who your competitive channels are. It's not, it's not competitive. That's the wrong word, but it's like people who watch you also watch these people and it's like three pages of maybe 10 channels per page or five channels per page, I don't remember.

And so it's a lot of, a lot of other channels that, you know, people who watch you watch these people. And so you can start to kind of think, what are the differences and similarities between. Us and them, and why is there a crossover between, you know. The thing that was really interesting that he pointed out yesterday is that neither one of you are on that list.

Oh, 

[00:28:02] David: I think you're on mine. That's weird. What? 

[00:28:05] Bob: Um, or at least on maybe the first page or something. I don't know the specifics. But, the thing that's really interesting about that discussion was that we, I think all of us as creators, people who create anything, not just YouTube stuff. You make anything. You have an ideal audience, the people that you think are your audience.

But the truth is you may have, it's very possible that you have a different audience than you think. And so we've realized that we probably have been. Assuming that our audience was one thing and that audience was dissatisfied with the videos that we've been putting out, but it turns out I think those people are actually a different group of people.

And then you get into the kind of, well, do I cater what I'm doing to the existing audience? And David, I think you said this a little while ago. Or do you make the things that you want for the audience that you want? Whether it's the current audience or not, you know? Yeah, 

[00:29:06] David: I think, um, uh, I, in this course that I took, you know, last fall, it was, there was a big section of this of trying to define your audience and there is, uh, there, there, there is an overlap of like this thing that you want to do, but also this thing that your audience wants you to do.

And there, there is a, there's a little overlap there because if you only do what you want to do, that's fine. But if you want to make a living, if you want to make, if you, we do this for money. Um, you sometimes have to compromise, that's not, it's probably not the right word, but you have to compromise and do what your audience wants for their satisfaction.

So there is this overlap, and so if I only did art, if I only did the things that I wanted, I think I would upset a lot of people. 

[00:30:04] Bob: Well, one of the words that we got to yesterday in that conversation was reframing. And I think it kind of works with what you're saying there. So, if I have a thing that I want to make because I'm Bob and I have a certain set of...

With interests and motivations, that's fine. Like you're saying, I can just make that thing, but it's only going to hit people who are very, very similar to me. And so, we started talking about with the kind of pre production and the thumbnail, how do we reframe that idea so that the idea is more broadly appealing, even though I get to make the same thing along the way.

Yeah. Which is kind of that overlap. Reframing. Intersection of those two things. And so, um. 

[00:30:45] Jimmy: I want to interject, I think maybe a lot of it, whether it's this audience or that audience, I don't know, I don't worry too much about it, as long as there is an audience, you understand? So if I think I'm going for, you know, overweight Home Depot guys with beards, 

[00:31:05] David: which seems to 

[00:31:08] Jimmy: be me and everybody that I meet, I mean, I fall right in that category.

And then you find out that it's women that like to knit, for instance. You know, my friend Anya, she's a knitter and we met in, we met in person over in England. She's not turning on table saws and stuff. But as long as there is an audience, when the, when the, like we think because the numbers are lower or that, that we're not hitting the right audience.

I think it's just the content in general, maybe just wasn't appealing to the algorithm and so you don't get suggested. I'm just happy there is an audience. It doesn't matter who it is. It could be schoolgirls, Catholic schoolgirls. It doesn't matter. As long as people are watching and getting some fun entertainment out of it in a positive, uplifting way, it doesn't have to be fat white guys from Home Depot.

[00:32:05] Bob: Yeah, I don't, I don't, and I don't think what I'm talking about, audience, I'm not, I'm not talking about a demographic at all. Yeah. What I'm talking about is an interest. So like if you, if you're making a, 

[00:32:17] Jimmy: I don't know. Yeah, like woodworkers versus auto repair guys. Are you talking about like a demographic of people that I'm looking 

[00:32:23] Bob: for?

Well, not, not a demographic, but an interest group. Oh, I meant to, you're right. And even that's a loaded thing to say, but like a... That's what I meant to say, not a demographic, of people who are interested in a topic. Right. Topical group, let's say that. So, you, you know, you can target a, a topical group, like, I want to make, I don't know, wooden tables.

And so, then you can say, well, uh, you know, what, I'm just going to make the wooden table I want and put it out there and hope that those people find it, or do I find a way to be in the place where other people who like wooden tables are going to be? What are they looking for? What are they interested in?

What other connective tissue are they, you know, are they searching for, or are they watching that's like... Are they into the joinery of the wooden table? Are they into trees and species? Are they, I don't, I don't know. I'm just making this up off the top of my head, but how do you find those people? I'm thinking of like, And then Taylor, the 

[00:33:21] Jimmy: thing that you want.

Johnson and I'm thinking of like guys 

[00:33:24] Bob: like that. Yeah. Like, and then how do you tailor the table that you want to make the video around that? To hit those ancillary points, so you have the most, the highest likelihood of getting your video in front of those people who have a similar interest. And so that's what I'm thinking about when I'm talking about audience.

Like we found, Josh found, through all this research that he did, that our biggest kind of interest topic is taking, uh, furniture, shop stuff, home renovation, and adding some sort of a... Plus to it, like a, a tech plus, you know, giving it some sort of an, an electrical electronic addition or some sort of a stylistic, you know, Star Wars flair or something like that.

And that was the crossover of the biggest group of people for us. And so that doesn't mean that we should just do that now, but it means that every time I come up with an idea, we should say, okay, well, can we plus it? Can we add? A tech thing to it. Can we add a, you know, a prop feel to it just to, to not only grab the people who are into the, um, the home renovation, but also the people who are into the prop side or into the electronics side, you know, and it was really interesting and it started making me take my, the ideas that I'm already working on for upcoming videos and be like, okay, well, instead of just going with idea number two on this path, what about if I did pause there and how can I make idea two into idea three or four or five and like add the things to it to be able to hit the broader the bigger overlapped audience you know and so i think you could do that in a bunch of different ways you could do that with like the technical side of it what it is you're making you could do it with like you're saying david with the story um you know by broadening You know, not just the desk, but the desk adds some nostalgia to it, so the people that grew up with that kind of desk has some sort of a connection, or I, you know, I don't know.

[00:35:34] Jimmy: The other thing too is you want to, in my opinion, I think what you want to do is also create word of mouth. One thing I, one thing I, for me for instance, I don't ever want to waste anybody's time. So my edits are really fast. I try to make them quick. I watch something. I'm like, this is boring me, and I shot it.

So I speed it up, cut it out, get rid of the superfluous conversation. Anytime I go, wait, wait a minute. Um, you know what I think? Uh, what we should do is, I cut all the beginning of that sentence out. So it just goes to what I think we should do is, and then it makes me seem smarter and wittier, and then that um, uh, um, e, uh, that, because the people will be like, oh god, this guy is so annoying.

So, I try and speed my stuff up for the audience so that the audience has word of mouth, like, he's not going to waste your time. And someone like, for instance, Casey Neistat, we all go to Casey for the beautiful, interesting, you know, driving through traffic and all of his beautiful... Cinematography. I mean, that's why I keep revisiting Casey Moseley and plus he has fun adventures.

So you try and think of what is that thing that's going to keep people coming back? Like the fun adventures, the diversity, the not going to waste anybody's time. I promise I'm going to show you almost everything, but it's going to be worth your time to sit through the speed it up 

[00:36:47] David: stuff. It's funny you Neistat because Bob's pick last week was Casey's interview.

with, uh, the, the channel Digital Spaghetti. Jack, Jack, what's his last name? Jack Kanye? Conte. Conte. Conte. And in that interview, Casey, he, he's asking, like, uh, Jack is asking Casey, like, about retention and analytics. Casey's like, I don't know. I don't look at any of that. He's like one of the very few creators that doesn't care who his audience is, and doesn't care about the analytics, and he is...

He's making pure art. He's like the, he's like the guy in the basement, like whittling ducks with no audience 

[00:37:31] Jimmy: at all. I can make, I can make an analogy there. I mean, obviously that would be nice for all of us not to worry about our audience because there's such a big audience. I mean, he's, he's a great creator.

That's why we keep talking about him. But I, I make the analogy of like, I stopped balancing my checkbook when I know there's just gonna always be enough money in the bank. Well, and he doesn't have to check his analytics because there's always going to be enough audience in the bank. Yeah, yeah, like, 

[00:37:52] Bob: I don't want this to sound cynical at all.

That's not my intent. But if I sold a company for several million dollars and was sitting on that, I wouldn't care about what the audience was asking for or saying either. I would just make the thing that I wanted to make and hope that it's useful to people. You know what I mean? I mean, 

[00:38:09] Jimmy: I think that's cool because what he makes is great.

[00:38:12] Bob: It's fantastic, and I'm happy for him to be able to do that, for sure, but I think that there is a little bit of a difference there. 

[00:38:18] Jimmy: I personally don't, I personally don't spend too much time checking the analytics, only because I honestly feel I have no control over it. I personally feel like, it's not because I think I have enough money in the bank, I just feel like I have no control, and I can just do, and I keep leaning on, right or wrong, I keep leaning on, okay.

What I've done got me here. What I've done got me here. Maybe there's like a little twist and turns and a little bit of adventure and you know I build a big barn and you know expand my my workspaces and try and step outside my comfort zone to try and get better at everything but in general I just keep leaning on like I don't know.

I don't know how I can turn this ship. I can just keep doing what I know works for me. To turn the ship in a big way, like the way maybe Mr. Beast had done, this, what a lot of people don't know about Mr. Beast is that he was just doing, I think he was doing video game videos, playing video games or something.

And then suddenly, you know, Casey does a great interview with him right in the beginning when he really started popping and he's like, here's a video from you from a year ago. It's got 10, 000 views or not even that many. What happened? And like, so obviously, uh, you know, to make a big shift like that. I don't, I don't, I don't know how I would do it.

I really don't know. I just got to keep doing what works for me. 

[00:39:34] Bob: Well, and I think that looking at the analytics can be. I mean, this was another point of conversation yesterday as well, is like, it can be, um, a blessing and a curse. Because from one perspective, you have all this, if you take the time, which I don't take the time.

I asked Josh to do this, because this is not something I'm interested in. If you take the time to go through and analyze it, you start to get a better idea of what has worked very specifically. In a video, what parts of videos have worked? Which videos have worked? Who are they hitting with? Who are you, who are your audience also watching?

You can get that idea, but then, that can either be like, oh, well now we know who to, who to target, how to do things, how not to do things, or it can be like, oh no. Now we have to change everything we're doing to meet these people, and that sounds terrible, like, I don't want to do that. Having all that information can be a big crutch, or it can be just a point of reference that then you use to make some choices, you know, so, 

[00:40:35] Jimmy: I think...

When you add in, like, having no control, really, other than just consistency, it's really the only control I think we all have. Then somebody changes your thumbnail and suddenly the video blows up. You're like, wait a minute, it's the same video. So, like, there's another, like, complete wildcard 

[00:40:51] David: factor. But if I looked at my analytics and I was like, okay, these are my top five performing videos in the last five years.

I should double down on that. I don't want to do that because those, those videos are the 10 best, 10 best, uh, 10 best butt joint methods, uh, how to do box joints. They are, those videos are actually really easy. If you're, if you're a new YouTuber and you want to do this for a living, do the 10 best 10 best that, how to do this, how to do that.

I get no enjoyment out of those whatsoever. So I'm going against my analytics to do more because I want to be challenged. I want to, I really want to enjoy this, and this as 

[00:41:33] Jimmy: long. One thing I wanted to, I wanted to give you just an idea and anybody listening, an idea you want to be challenging on client work.

Without just casting a wide net, walk into a bar or restaurant and say, what do you need? I need a video on one of 

[00:41:48] David: those chairs that are broken and wobbly. 

[00:41:51] Jimmy: It could be that, or it could be, Oh, you know, when the waiters come over here, they need this thing. They need to put their computer here and this here.

It's always a bottleneck. If you walk into any restaurant, cause that's what I did a lot of the times in New York city, any restaurant or bar, you must have a couple of bars that you're familiar with. I know, I know you like to kick back every once in a while, go in, especially if it's a familiar place, go in and say, what can I do?

Give me a real job, and you know, maybe you do it for free, simply because you just want a real client experience. Because you want the video, and you want to build something interesting. But that would give you that challenge that you're looking at. Because now, not only, not only are you making it for you for your video, but you want to make sure that they're happy.

Even if they're not paying for it. You don't want to bring them something and then go, oh, thanks for the waiter station, Dave. 

[00:42:36] David: The problem with that is talking to strangers. I do not like talking to strangers. 

[00:42:40] Bob: Having to leave the 

[00:42:41] David: house. I gotta leave the house? Are you kidding me? Let me, let me ask Kelly what she wants.

No, no, I 

[00:42:48] Jimmy: do know. It's like, it's like that guy that knocks on someone's door and he's like, Hey, um, is it okay if I mow your lawn? I'm not going to charge you anything. 

[00:42:55] David: Yeah, that is really interesting. There's um, there's like a series of videos. I don't know who the dude is, but he like knocks on, uh, wealthy people's doors and ask them what they do for a living.

And it's turned into like this great series. series. But that, uh, that would be, um, what you just said would be an amazing series that would probably do 

[00:43:17] Jimmy: very well. Just walk into a restaurant or a bar. I'm telling you, because I know you have hundreds of patterns throughout a restaurant or a bar, and there's so many solves that they just don't know anybody.

Like, you know, they have a handyman that fixes the drains. That's it. Like, can you, Bill? Can you? And then that's when you see, like, Walk through any restaurant or any bar and you see those like stupid L brackets that you buy from Home Depot, screwed in with four different screws to hold something in place.

There's always these makeshift things because bartenders are not makers in general and waitresses are not makers in general, waiters and waitresses in general. So you have all and then the other thing too is it's like nobody invests the time and energy because they're like Let's just do like some little fix and fix them up in here But if you can come in and give them nice solutions to their to their circular activity Solve some problems and then you get a cool video and you get a real life client job And then you get probably free free food for a couple months 

[00:44:19] David: That's what I need.

It's more food

[00:44:23] Bob: Um, well, any other thoughts on the audience stuff? I 

[00:44:27] David: think it does translate. It feels weird talking about the back end of YouTube, but it does translate to the person who makes farmhouse tables and tries to sell farmhouse tables. Do you really enjoy making the same table over and over and over again? Or do you want to, uh, cause you know it sells or do you want to expand and do a trestle table next time and, and see?

So I think the audience also expands to customer base if you're 

[00:44:53] Bob: making stuff for a living. But it but to be fair there are people that really enjoy making the same thing over and over I don't know so I don't want to like I Don't get it either, but I don't want to squash that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah something bad It's just a different thing than what 

[00:45:08] David: we do.

You know, there's no doubt. Those are the same people that enjoy sanding

[00:45:14] Bob: Yeah, probably I don't get those people um, so we earlier you said something about And Jimmy, you said something about, um, people in Toledo wanting David's desk, and all you had to do was put that call out there. Last week, you... Asked for emails about my engine rebuild. Did anybody write you an email? 

[00:45:37] Jimmy: Oh yeah, I was gonna talk to you about that.

[00:45:39] Bob: Nobody wrote you an email. Nobody wrote me an email. . I 

[00:45:42] Jimmy: knew it. I knew it. I'm kidding. No, I didn't. Unless it's in the, in the filter. I could look now, hold on. Lemme say I'm gonna open up the junk. No, no. I, I, Bob's engine repair. Bob's Engine repair. Bob's engine. 

[00:45:53] Bob: I don't really want anybody to do it, but I was just curious if you could get a response.

Who 

[00:45:57] David: do you want your audience to be? Who do you want to be? Me? Yeah. 

[00:46:02] Bob: Oh 

[00:46:02] Jimmy: man. I just wanted to be anybody and everybody. 

[00:46:07] Bob: Uh, 

[00:46:08] David: do you really want it to be anybody and everybody because Sure. Does it feel like a community if, if everybody watches your videos or if like-minded people watch your video? Like, I, I feel like 

[00:46:20] Bob: if I don't really want, I, it depends on what you mean by like-minded.

What I would, for me personally, what I would prefer is if the people who were seeing our videos were people who. Um, who didn't have, didn't grow up with the opportunity to make the things that they wanted to have, for whatever reason. And never got the opportunity to experiment with building things, and using tools.

I want somebody... Who always had an interest, but never had an opportunity to see something that we do and be like, Oh, well, maybe it's time I actually like do the thing that I was interested in. Whether it's building stuff or something else. And I think that's the, the aspirational thing that I want people to take away.

And for them to be able to take that way away from our videos, that means there has to be a gap. in them somewhere that they didn't get to try the thing or they were never encouraged to build stuff or they were never given the opportunity to use tools or experiment or problem solve or that's who i want my audience to be you know like i i'm not skilled enough to teach a skilled craftsperson to do something better that's not what i do and i don't i wouldn't presume to like teach woodworkers how to woodwork better.

That's just not me. Um, and I hope they find something valuable in what we do as well, but I don't, that's not who I'm aiming at, you know. But at the same time, like, I don't know how you, when you take kind of an abstract group of people like that, who, who are only connected necessarily through an abstract idea, like, how do you target that group of people?

How do you find 

[00:48:06] Jimmy: those? That's, that gets back to me just being like, I don't think I have any control over it. It's got to put out content that's fun and funny and interesting and educational. If a grandma that never picks up tools loves it, that's great. And if guys like us like it, that's great. And if guys in third world country get inspired by it.

Did I ever tell you this story? This is a funny, funny, funny story. Maybe I've told you this and I'm sorry if you heard it again. But for the people that haven't heard it, my buddy was in Thailand. Getting a foot massage at a fancy hotel, and we lived in New York City together for, not, you know, he was a friend from New York City, he still lives in New York City, and this is like five years ago, he was getting a foot massage from a local guy who does foot massages at a hotel, I have no idea, in Thailand, and the gentleman said to him, Where do you live?

And Chris says, I'm from New York City. He goes, Oh, my favorite YouTuber is from New York City. Jimmy Diresta. Do you know him? Chris said he nearly fell off of the chair. He couldn't believe it. And he sent me a message within a, within a couple of minutes. You know, the time difference was drastic, but I was awake and I sent him a picture back and he sent me a picture back.

So like in a second, this guy like connected with me just literally randomly mentioning my name to Chris. That is getting a foot massage in the lobby of a hotel in Thailand with like, you know, linen curtains blowing. It was like this real romantic scene. And it's just amazing. Like, I wouldn't know that this person in Thailand was my audience who does foot massages.

I should do a foot massage video now. 

[00:49:41] Bob: Yeah, you totally 

[00:49:42] Jimmy: should. But that's a true story. And it's just crazy. You just don't know who's watching. Yeah. But Chris said, he goes, the guy started and he goes within 10 seconds, your name was mentioned because I couldn't believe it because I was just so flabbergasted.

It was a really funny story. 

[00:49:58] Bob: That's pretty wild. Uh, David, who do you want your audience to be? 

[00:50:03] David: I want, who I really want them to be is creative. I wish it was a whole, uh, just an audience of nothing but artists, people who just make things. And like seeing things being made for the fun of it. Um, that's not possible.

I think most of the audience is people who just enjoy the entertainment of seeing builds, whether they're creative or not. And then there's a part of the audience who's looking to actually learn something. But yeah, I wish the audience was 5 million David Picciutos. That's who I want the audience to be.

Well, that'll never happen, but... 

[00:50:47] Bob: Because there's only one David Picciuto. There's only one 

[00:50:50] David: David 

[00:50:50] Bob: Picciuto. Actually, there might be more. I don't know if anybody shares your name. But, there's only one like you. Yeah. 

[00:50:58] David: Like, I, um, I, I, I struggle with Jimmys, like, I just want everybody to, to watch. It's like, uh, I would have more fun going to...

Coachella, then I would go into the State Fair, because Coachella is... More like minded people than the State Fair. 

[00:51:23] Jimmy: I could just picture you in a white cowboy hat with a fringy skirt on. Yeah,

[00:51:32] David: that's all. 

[00:51:33] Bob: Yeah, 

[00:51:34] David: okay. Although, just for clarity, I will never go to Coachella. That's too many people to be around. Or the 

[00:51:41] Jimmy: State Fair. Or 

[00:51:43] David: the State 

[00:51:44] Bob: Fair. Cool. Well, I'm gonna thank our Patreon supporters, um, who allow us to not go to state fairs and stay home and not have to interact with a whole lot of people.

They are supportive and we really appreciate them. Big thanks to everybody over there that helps us out. Um, especially our top supporters, Corey Ward, Albers Woodworks, Works by Solo, Chad from Manecrafting, Chad's Custom Creations, Rich at Low End Design, Odin Leather Goods, Scott Orem, The New Janky Workshop, Stu Morrison, Warren Works, Michael Minedge, and the Web Branch Woodworks and Craptree Creative.

But also people like Tom Funk, he's one of our, that's an actual person with a cool last name. Um. There's a lot of people to help us out over there, and they all get the after show. We are very grateful for all of them. So if you want to... Well, there's one on here named Stark's Lagoon. Now, I wonder if that's a name, or if that's like a business.

I guess it's a name, and that's a really cool name. Starks 

[00:52:47] David: Lagoon. I'm stealing that. Change my YouTube channel 

[00:52:52] Bob: to Starks Lagoon. I like your name. Starks Lagoon. If you want to join that crew and get the after show, go to patreon. com slash making it and if you have a really cool name maybe I'll say it on the show sometime because I like cool names.

[00:53:05] Jimmy: Yeah, I follow Starks when I talk. He's a good dude. Oh yeah? He's been a big fan for a long time. Right on. 

[00:53:11] Bob: Well, tell him he's got a cool name. Um, so, side note real quick before we do, uh, the next thing. What, what platform do you think has the coolest usernames? I have, there's one that I think has the best usernames.

Reddit. Have you ever thought about this? Reddit. Do what? Reddit. Reddit. Reddit? Yeah. Oh, okay. Well, I've never really compared that one. Um... 

[00:53:38] Jimmy: I don't know, YouTube? Hmm. Tinder? I don't know. 

[00:53:43] Bob: So, in my experience, I don't have Tinder experience, but I don't either. Uh, Instagram has like, just the best usernames, and I don't know why, I'm not sure there are good usernames on all platforms, but there's something about the ones that I come across on Instagram that are just really clever.

Or funny. And the one that comes to mind is somebody that's been following, I think, all of us for a long time. TurboButt3000. It's just like, you're listening right now. I almost guarantee that he's listening right now. And I love that username. I don't know why, but that's one of the ones that stuck out, that has stuck out to me.

Anyway, thanks for spawning that conversation, Starks. I appreciate it. Do you guys have anything to recommend this week? Yeah, 

[00:54:32] David: the Lucas County Fair. 

[00:54:35] Jimmy: Is that 

[00:54:36] David: really a thing? Uh, that's, that's, that's my local county fair. That's gonna be my pick of the week. Oh, 

[00:54:40] Bob: so instead of state fairs, you just go to county 

[00:54:42] David: fairs?

Yeah, yeah. Um, so that's, that's my, that's my, I'm actually not going to the Lucas County Fair. There is a woodworking thing that I'm going to in Adrian, Michigan on Father's Day. I'm just gonna go there as a spectator. Um, but, uh, I think it's called the Great Lakes Woodworking something, something or other.

I don't know. Anyway, I'll be there. I'll be wandering around. In disguise. With a white cowboy hat. With a white cowboy hat. And my actual pick of the week is, where'd it go? Where'd it go? Last night I watched an interview with Rick Rubin on 60 Minutes. And that dude is the most chill dude you will ever find in the history of people.

[00:55:22] Jimmy: I listened. Did you listen to his interview with Jimmy Iovine? No. I don't know what. What podcast it was, it, there's a podcast that he does and him and Jimmy Iovine had a long conversation about just the history of music and hip hop, and it's great. Yeah. Jimmy Iovine's always an interesting interview and together they're amazing.

Yeah. 

[00:55:39] David: Uh, Rick, he's so, like, he was a party dude back in the day, and then he's completely transformed with meditation and, and, uh, everything he's into now, but he's like, he's produced Slayer LL Cool j Johnny Cash, like it's Johnny Cash. It's 

[00:55:57] Jimmy: bonkers. Yeah. In that interview he said LL Cool J sent him a demo tape of a 16 year old kid from Queens.

Yeah. And he, can you imagine he met LL Cool J when he was 16 with a demo tape. Basically 

[00:56:09] David: put Public Enemy on the map. He heard some sort of radio jingle and sought out the dude who did the, the rap and the radio jingle, which happened to be Chuck D. And like, yeah, and, and then Slayer. Like he went from hip hop and then like to Slayer, which makes absolutely no sense, but makes all the sense.

[00:56:31] Bob: Then Johnny Cash. Nine Inch Nails, Johnny Cash. Yeah. Um. Yeah. Um. Yeah, there's been a bunch of people. Pretty wild. Metallica, I think? Jimmy, what you 

[00:56:41] Jimmy: got? Uh, I'm gonna, everyone keeps asking me on the, on the back side of things. If, uh, Keith Rutger is working on my four foot... Capacity bandsaw, which was like a 12 foot tall bandsaw, the wheels were 4 feet in diameter.

It was a bandsaw for a caboose factory in Waycrush, Georgia. And about a year and a half ago, probably going on 2 years now. Keith was contacted by the man who bought the building that was dilapidated, and these two bandsaws were in there. So Keith mentioned to me, does anybody, you know, want these? I said, I do.

So I made a fast deal with the gentlemen, just a few hundred dollars, because they were just so big, and Keith's like, I have a great idea. I'll recover them for you, bring them to my place, which was in his vicinity, and I'll restore one of them. and we haven't talked about money he says don't worry about the money i just want the content and so he's restoring and he goes i don't want the band saws i just want the content so he's going to restore one of them to working condition which is looking beautiful by the way he's got about 12 or 13 videos up since he started it and one video might be just how to pull a wheel off or just how to relay the mandrel or something they're very specific to various different parts of the restoration so check out keith rocker's channel Vintage, vintage machinery, and you'll see him doing the series on the bandsaw, which I will ultimately take possession of and like everybody's like, Oh, I got a big bandsaw.

My bandsaw has got three foot diameter wheels. This one's got four foot diameter wheels. Whoa. Yeah. Cool. It's, the wheels are so big that you need to, it's a Faye and Egan. Brands for the tool nerds out there and the wheel has to go through the floor a little bit So you need to cut out like a notch So you need an arc in the floor that goes so that they have the castings That's the two feet and the the arc of the bottom wheel comes down below So you'd need to set a spot up in the floor or just have it up on big blocks and then a set of stairs In front of it to step up to it, which is probably how I'll do it.

You even 

[00:58:48] David: bandsaw bro? 

[00:58:51] Jimmy: Do you even bandsaw? 

[00:58:54] David: Not unless you have a wheel that goes into the 

[00:58:55] Jimmy: floor. Oh, and I also wanted just to make this official announcement. July 1st is the racetrack event at my go kart track. So if anybody in the Northeast or anybody in the world wants to come on July 1st, it's the Saturday before July 4th, and that's when it is.

Either hang out with me or hang out with your family. That's your choice. 

[00:59:14] David: Man. 

[00:59:16] Jimmy: Yeah. No, because everybody wants to, like, can you move it to another day when I don't have to have hamburgers with my family? The hardcore, the hardcore go kart heads will be there. And I bought parts to start making my go kart.

I have four weeks to make everything in my whole life. So one of those four things, one of those many things is the go kart. I'm making a go kart kind of old school with like kind of, I got these cool wheels from Harbor, not Harbor Freight, but Tractor Supply. They're like spoked wheels. So it's gonna be kind of look, it's gonna look like an old like something in the, in the realm of like the first generation of automobile.

Kind of like a flat plank of wood with like four big wheels. And yeah, I was going to go electric, but I don't know. I think I'm just going to go gas. It's easy. Cool. 

[01:00:03] Bob: Um, mine is a YouTube course that was recommended to me, and I just started going through it last night, so I'm not very far in, but it's, um, a course by Colin and Samir, who do great videos, and it's all about them teaching storytelling, and it was just one of those things that looked, I like their videos, and it looked like it'd be beneficial, so I started going through it, and it's got some really cool exercises to do some of the stuff that we talked about today about audience and story and...

Um, it was pretty cheap too, I think it was like 80 bucks, you know, for two and a half hours of video about storytelling. 

[01:00:43] Jimmy: Oh, bless you. Oh my god, I just unmuted myself to cough, sorry. You could have heard what I was doing, I was muted. 

[01:00:51] Bob: Well anyway, so I did that course, er, I got that course, I've just started it.

I like it so far. So if you're interested, go check that out. I'm, 

[01:00:58] David: I, I apologize for always hijacking your picks every single week, but I love Colin and Samir and yesterday on their main channel, they put out a interview with two of the try guys and we watched the try guys every once in a while, and I'm like, just sit back and this will just be, it's like a two hour long interview.

And it, I learned so much from that interview. They talk about storytelling and they talk about, there's a section of this where they talk about storytelling a lot and they reveal of like, not everything is shown on the video happened in a linear time. They will move things around. To have a flow of ups and downs that doesn't take away from what they're doing, but it gives the story a little bit more oomph.

And it was very interesting. It's movie magic, but it makes total sense. I don't know. Check out Bob's Pick, and then all of Colin Samir's interviews are just fantastic, and it's very insightful.

[01:02:12] Bob: Alright, well let's go do the after show, because I want to tell you about my plasma table. Oh boy! Thanks for listening everybody! Thank you, thank you. Bye. Thank you. We'll catch you next time.
