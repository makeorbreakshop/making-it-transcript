394-Making It
===

[00:00:00] Jimmy: Yeah, so Make 48 is a show where contestants, there's teams, there's seven teams, and most of them are families, so it's kind of fun. You see mom and dad and the kids and close friends make up a team, some student groups, and they get an opportunity to develop an invention, and they have 48 hours to make that invention, present it, and then win a prize.

And in the past I was a judge, in the past I was the host, and this time around I was a helper, or a mentor. You help The people with their inventions, there's sort of strict rules that they're not allowed to use certain tools. I think that's more for safety than anything else because it's a variety of skill sets, a variety of skill levels.

So, I just say no one's allowed to use the power tools. So that, in that case, it's me and the group of, the group of, they call them tool techs. So me and the group of tool techs are allowed to use the tools. It was fun. There was a couple of friends there that I've seen over the years. We had a nice time, and the team I helped the most won, so that was very nice.

It was nice to see that they were a really good group of girls. And, uh, so I was in Kansas City, and while I was there I got a cold. So that's why my voice is... And I got home the morning of my birthday. And then, uh, I relaxed. I didn't do much until the evening. Just doing my mail and... Dilly dallying around.

Sometimes I'm actually okay with not doing anything and just slowly took care of the chickens and didn't jump right back into anything until yesterday. Which was 

[00:01:27] Bob: Wednesday. I've found that more and more lately in the last couple of years where I used to feel kind of bad or just unsettled about taking a morning and just like not doing anything.

And now, like on occasion, it's pretty nice just to... Just sit around and, you know, like, before lunch or whatever for a little while and just kind of not do anything. Yeah. Scrolling 

[00:01:49] Jimmy: helps. Instagram helps. Oh, yeah. TikTok. Thanks, 

[00:01:54] Bob: TikTok. That feels like such a waste of time. I mean, I do it, too. But, like, man, I catch myself so often just like, what am I doing?

I'm like, I'm not even looking at this stuff. I'm just passing it. Yeah. One more. Oh, wait. 

[00:02:06] Jimmy: One more. One more. 

[00:02:08] David: Yeah. Yeah. 

[00:02:08] Jimmy: Yeah. But, I'm okay with relaxing a little bit more often these days. 

[00:02:15] Bob: Yeah. As you should. We, we should have all figured that out a long time ago, because it 

[00:02:20] Jimmy: would actually be better for us.

But you feel like we gotta keep jammin and jammin you know, we've all selected a, a job that is almost 100 percent reliant on us individually, so, when the shark stops swimmin It's a hard time surviving. 

[00:02:37] Bob: It's funny because I had a conversation with my team about that specifically, um, a couple days ago, about the realization that I've come to, this is totally off, I was not planning on talking about this, but since we're here, um, I came to a realization over the past few months or whatever, and I was thinking about the team and their, their jobs and their Like, what they offer and all this stuff, and I realized that they came on to work for I Like To Make Stuff, basically to support me at the time.

Like, I needed help with X, so somebody came on to do that, to help the whole thing move. But then over, since then, now that we have a group of people, it's not just them supporting me. Like, everybody has independent jobs that overlap and we support each other and... You know, they're helping me accomplish things, and they're also accomplishing things on their own.

And it's really interesting to step back and look at the whole thing, and it's not like they're, uh, what they do every day is not just because of me, it's because of them. And they can generate their own thing that helps the whole group flourish. It was a really interesting, like, huh, when did that happen?

Like, it's been happening. It, it, I guess, continues to happen. It's a, a different kind of thing. And so it's still, a lot of it does rely on my face and everything, but I think we're trying to move past that to where my face is not as necessary. Because my face is not that great, 

[00:04:06] Jimmy: so. 

[00:04:08] Bob: But. Anyway, yeah, trying to get out of that so that I can have more mornings to goof off and scroll, I guess.

What have you been working on since, uh, 

[00:04:18] Jimmy: since you've been back? Well, last night I'm just actually looking at, I just, uh, went on the How To app and I'm posting some stuff. I just posted... I've been posting reels, and occasionally I make a reel and it goes on all the apps. Last night I made a reel of me working on the sewing machine.

I got a Weaver 205 sewing machine. I had one, and I left it at Taylor's studio because she uses it for work, so I let her keep it. So I bought a new one. A Weaver 205 is this giant sewing machine. So last night I was inspired to play with it when I got home, and I started making these wallets. So I'm making 12 wallets.

I took basically a quarter height of leather. Put it on the laser cutter and cut out as many wallets as would fit in it and started putting the little production together of those wallets and last night I was on that machine. So I started working on that and I'm working on this week I'm going to do a tips video on the bandsaw.

I haven't done a tips video in a while and by popular demand a lot of people are asking me bandsaw questions so I'm going to do a tips video on the bandsaw. So that should be an easy shoot. I might do most of that today. The wallet video will probably be out in two weeks and then uh... I'm slowly getting ahead of the videos but in the idea stage.

This week I did the video of me making the model of the workshop. And it's actually, it's a great performing video. It might hit 400, 000 today. For me it's a, it's a rarity these days. But that video I didn't think of until I started about 20 minutes before I started it. And it's always those videos that do well.

I was going back and forth and I was like, I gotta, I had to make a model. To fill my obligation for type on glue. And in the past I've done these Popsicle stick models and I was like, what can I make? I already did the Eiffel Tower, a bridge, like what can I make? That's kinda something that the fans would be interested in seeing.

And I thought about the Arctic Triumph, but I was like, that's, it's too fancy. And plus it'll look ugly and ice cream sticks. And uh, and then it occurred to me, why did I do the shop? 'cause if I wanna do the second floor idea. And I thought of it about an hour before I started making it. I went on, I went on uh, Illustrator and I laid out all the girders and all the laser cut parts and they were fast, those fast sketch ups.

And uh, I went to work on it. And I had no idea that people would be interested in watching it. I thought it was going to be another 50k view video and that would be that. But, it's going strong. Pretty amazed. 

[00:06:43] Bob: What are the comments like on that? I mean, to have that kind of a surprise take off. Surely there's some feedback about why.

Is there 

[00:06:49] Jimmy: anything? No, no, people just, I love you. And then, you know, I've been kind of down in the dumps as far as the algorithm goes. Obviously we all joke about it, but when I started that week, my, my subscriber count was negative 500. For the first time I'd ever noticed. I mean, occasionally we all get that negative and we know there's like a big purge.

Yeah. YouTube will purge out all bad accounts. But for like almost two months in a row, my subscriber count was negative 500. And now it's plus 500. I've added maybe 1, 500 subscribers since this video has taken off. And my view count was at like 900, 000 for the month. It's over like a million and change.

So it's amazing that just these few days, I mean it hasn't even been a week, that this video is performing and bringing some attention to the channel. I did notice a lot of video, a lot of this, the comments, oh, this is, this is great, I really love what you do, subscribed, so there's a lot of new viewers that this video is pushing to new people.

Most of the people make a comment of like, if you're undecisive about it, because I didn't want to lose the big air space in the cathedral ceiling, I was only going to do it two thirds of the way. A lot of people are like, just cut it right down in the middle, like put it right at the halfway mark, which I thought was a pretty cool idea, because then I could still keep a big giant ceiling, so.

That might be a possibility, that I only go the halfway mark. And then one of the fans in the comment section is like, Hey, I manufacture engineered trusses, reach out to me, let's talk. So, that was really cool, so I'm in a conversation with him. And, uh, yeah, it was, it's funny when you just think of something, you throw it out there and suddenly a whole new, good can of worms opens up.

And that was that kind of thing. And a lot of things fell into place because my sticker, my little stained glass sticker that's the image that's on the building, was the right size as far as scale goes, within reason. And then I had printed all these Formlab figurines of us that 3D DIY Dave had scanned a lot of the makers.

And I scanned basically the cast, although Graz isn't in there, he hasn't gotten scanned yet. And I had the figurines sitting around and they were the right scale too. I did a half inch, I did a half inch to a foot and so they were three inches so we're all about six feet tall. So it was like the perfect scale.

So all these like things I did in the previous to this idea all like kind of fit together. So it was, it was fun and it just keeps growing every time I open it up. It's got like almost a hundred thousand views since yesterday and the video's out for like four or five days which is unthinkable. That's awesome.

[00:09:28] Bob: It doesn't happen anymore. David, that's happening with you too, right? Yeah, I, 

[00:09:32] David: um, I mean... My channel is a lot smaller than you guys, so the, for a while, the, the baseline and the goal was, I want to get 50, 000 views within a week. And now I'm hitting 50, 000 views, like all of a sudden, like, uh, the same day.

That's great. And like 7 out of the last 10 videos are over 100, 000. A couple of them are like, over 300, 000 views. That's amazing. So there's, there's just kind of been a change in the mindset and who I, I'm trying to make videos for and it's, it's just, I, after seeing it go down for a while, you know, I got a little worried and now there's, there's, it just feels different.

It feels like there's, there's hope. Yep. Yeah. 

[00:10:19] Bob: Hmm. I hope we get to that too. 

[00:10:23] Jimmy: There is hope, Bob. And it's, it's, it's, 

[00:10:25] David: I think the three of us, we've always chosen careers where, especially when you work for yourself, YouTube or outside of YouTube, you always kind of have to be on your, on your toes and ready to pivot and YouTube is, you have to be ready to pivot, but it's pivoting more often.

Like, I was, I went to school for graphic design, but then I ended up being a web developer. I also worked at, uh, as a photographer, and at a recording studio. So, yeah. Oh, God. Yeah, that was, that was loud. 

[00:11:03] Jimmy: That was loud. I'm so sorry, I thought I was on mute. Good thing I didn't fart while that was 

[00:11:09] David: on. So, I've always been in the mindset of, like, just be willing to pivot.

But with the YouTube thing, it's, you feel like you have to pivot a little bit more. And, uh, I just, I stopped making videos, I stopped making the videos that I thought I should be making, and I'm making the videos that I want to be making. And it was kind of like a gamble on myself, and it's working. It's just, I don't I don't try to make, I don't do the how to, I don't try to do the, like, what Bob would say, the lowest common denominator, does this audience have this tool?

I'm trying to focus on, on being creative, I'm having a lot more fun with my brother in the shop, just like, joking back and forth, and just kind of leaving in the real moments, and it's working. 

[00:11:57] Bob: Hmm, that's great. Well, what have you been, uh, making? 

[00:12:01] David: So... Uh, last week we put out the video of making fine furniture with a 2x4, and that video came out on Sunday, and it took a little bit longer than expected to make that video, so I was working and filming all the way up through Saturday, and so this week I decided I need a, and I was working in the evenings too, and I was like, I just need a break.

I need a, I need an easy week. So, we filmed the intro to a couple of new videos, and they're not going to be completed. So, the rest of the week I'm going to work on website stuff, pay stupid taxes, and things like that. And just enjoy my evenings of, you know, hanging out with Kelly, watching movies, and just not...

I'm not being concerned about editing or videos, but the two videos that we started... One is we went to the Goodwill and we found a little kid's wooden chair that folds up. And so we're going to use that as a model to make a human sized chair that folds up. 

[00:13:07] Bob: Human. Everybody knows the kids are not human.

Right. 

[00:13:13] David: You grow into being human. Oh, okay, yeah. At least some kids do. Some kids grow into being demons at first. You 

[00:13:19] Jimmy: start out as a pupa. Yeah. 

[00:13:23] David: So, um, we, we, we found this chair at the Goodwill and we brought it back and we took a bunch of photos of it, some measurements and took it apart, trying to figure out the, the mechanics of it.

And then we'll, we'll make it big size. And then we also went to, um, we went to Target and we found a MagnaDoodle, like the, the old sketchboards. We got one of those. Uh, we gutted it and now I'm going to make like a wooden. Fancy frame thing and it's gonna hang on the wall. So it's a magnidoodle but super fancy.

So those are the, those are the two videos that we're working on. That's 

[00:14:02] Bob: pretty cool. Yeah. Awesome. Um, so let's see for me, oh actually I had another question for you before I get to that. Yeah. So before we started recording you were talking about how the weather is like, it's warm there, it's in the 70s or something.

Yeah. As temperatures are changing... As, you know, you move into spring and stuff, is that going to affect you working on the car, or in the shop, or any of those kind of outstanding things in progress? 

[00:14:35] David: Speaking of the car, I got it out a couple times this year and there's with the construction on the house sometimes the the crew would work in the garage and so the garage got kind of dusty and the car was just covered in in dust.

Took it out and I know some people are gonna yell at me and that's okay because I totally ignorant but I took the car through an automatic car wash. Yeah and I broke off the antenna. Like, like, like, the antenna didn't break, uh, 

[00:15:10] Jimmy: yeah, it, 

[00:15:11] Bob: it, it, 

[00:15:11] David: it, it popped out of the body and bent the body a little bit, it's on the back rear fender, and um, and a piece of trim, there's a vinyl top to it, and a piece of trim blew off, uh, so a couple A couple little damages going through the automatic car wash.

Do not take a classic car through the automatic car wash. Noted. Dad would be so upset with me right now. Um, but one of the issues with the car that it wasn't, I was afraid to drive it is it had a bald tire. I didn't know it. I took it in to get some work done last summer and they said, oh yeah, it's bumpy because you have a bad tire.

Tires are like 30 some years old. So I went and got new tires just yesterday. And of course with a classic car you want, you want nice tires. So I got the raised white leather tires so it looks muscly. And it was like 950 for four new tires. Like holy cow. Um, so my budget for the car has maxed out for the time being.

So there's not going to be any more work on the car for a little bit. Um, but, uh, except I'm going to, the trim that blew off that I lost for the vinyl top, it's not like, I don't believe it is a piece of trim that you can just order for a 1967 Impala because the vinyl top was added post by my dad. So I think the trim was made and bent by.

Professional. So I gotta, it'll be a fun little experiment to see if I can find a piece of trim and then bend it to get it. In the place or whatever 

[00:16:49] Bob: hmm. Yeah. Yeah, that'll be interesting 

[00:16:52] David: and the antenna I can I can fix so it's it's one of those things where If you open up the trunk you can see where the antenna goes into and there's a screw on the top and a screw on the And there's a weather seal.

I can, I can fix that. I would also, I need to research to see if there's like a flexi antenna instead of the, the telescopic type one. Yeah. Oh 

[00:17:18] Jimmy: yeah. I'm sure there is. Is the telescopic one manual or is it one that was automatic? Manual. the automatic ones that were 

[00:17:23] David: for. Yeah, I remember, yeah, this one was manual.

Even manual, it only, it goes down and it still sticks up, you know, a good 15, 16 inches. 

[00:17:32] Bob: Oh. For my white line cruiser, the, I never used the radio, and you know, it's not a classic car, I mean, I guess it is a classic car, but it's not in the same way that yours is. And I just took off the... Just unscrewed the antenna.

And so the nub is still there, still sealed, but I just took it off because like, it's another thing to break. It's another thing to get caught on stuff. But then I tried to take that thing through a car wash one time, not really thinking about it. And as I pulled up, the guy was like, yeah, you can't come through here in that.

I'm like, why not? He's like, because you have a rack and a snorkel, and uh, you know, he's like, you will get clogged in the machine, like you can't. And it dawned on me at the time, that like, oh, I guess I... Can't. I mean, it makes sense, but I didn't think about it before that. On the Karmagia, um, when I was taking the whole thing apart, I actually removed the antenna and patched the hole.

Because I'm already down to bare metal. So, uh, I went ahead and made a patch panel and just completely covered that hole because I'm not going to put it back on. I think it's cleaner without it. It's like one less thing to have to wire and, you know. Yeah. Um, so. I've, 

[00:18:41] David: I've had the thoughts of like, I... I can't remember the last time I listened to radio in a car ever and do I, do I, do I need this antenna?

Do I, do I have this hole patched? Are there kits to like just patch the hole for people who don't want an antenna? So it's something, something I got to look into. 

[00:19:01] Bob: I would imagine that you could probably take the existing fixture that it's on and, and you know, like leave the hole in the body, leave the weather sealing and then just.

Make a, an insert to go in where the actual post goes to. So it's like there. Usable in the future if you wanted it, but 

[00:19:19] David: not stick. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like a little, like a little, uh, conference table grommet type thing. 

[00:19:24] Bob: Yeah. Yeah. Or you put like a tiny little radio dish on it that looks like a . It spins around

That'd 

[00:19:29] David: be cool. Little satellite dish. 

[00:19:31] Jimmy: Yeah, a little satellite. That's funny. Least it's funny. My new truck, I get phone calls from satellite radio about every 20 minutes saying, do you, you wanna turn on? Oh my goodness. Yeah. I, I haven't turned the satellite on in the new truck. I have it in my little, my little truck.

And all I ever do is listen to the music on my phone, so in my new truck I have the stuff like the Sirius Radio and regular radio. And I just, I never, it's just going to be another subscription that's like pointless because I never listen. Oh yeah. 

[00:19:59] Bob: Um, there's a, I don't know if I told you all about this or not, but I was looking at like retro stereo, like retro look stereos.

We have one. Oh, you do? For your car? 

[00:20:13] David: Yeah, it looks like it's, uh, of the time period, but it's a whole Bluetooth radio. 

[00:20:18] Bob: Yeah. Yeah. It's such a cool thing. When I was looking at the car at the beginning, I don't need it yet, so I haven't really looked that far into it. But I was blown away at how simple on the front of them they look.

You know, it has like the little... It's not a dial, but the, the band, and like three buttons, two knobs, but it's bluetooth. Mm hmm. 

[00:20:36] David: It's pretty awesome. So it looks, so it looks like it's got the two dials, and it looks like you could turn the one down, and a little orange needle moves, but when you turn the car on, um, there's, it's like a blue LED behind that, that lights up, and then you can see it says bluetooth as it lights up, and then shows the song that's playing, but as soon as you turn the car off, it looks like it's 

[00:20:55] Bob: stock.

Oh, that's awesome. I didn't even know it did that. That's great. Uh, Jimmy, did you get the car? Are you getting the car? 

[00:21:03] Jimmy: I committed to it. I'll probably get it this month. I did commit to it, so. We haven't, I've asked him to send me the title and a photograph, and he's like, Oh, well, well, well, so. Oh, that's right.

It's a little red flag, so. I'm hoping, if he doesn't send me the title, I might not go and get it until he does, if he's trying to be sneaky. But he's been traveling, I've been traveling, so. I said sometime in the middle of this month. But yeah, that's gonna be fun. Cool. And then I got the house, I think I talked about it on Instagram, I did.

I'm going to do a video introducing the house that shows all the details and what's to come. What's the 

[00:21:36] Bob: first thing happening 

[00:21:37] Jimmy: over there? I want to work on the floors, because the floors are a little uneven here and there, and then there's uh, some shoring up that needs to take place in the basement, but it's all, it's all like arrested right now, because the previous owner bought those, those columns, those adjustable columns from Home Depot, so I could just leave it as is, or go in there and and use his columns and then redo some one side of the foundation is just a little cockeyed but it's been that way it's been that way probably for 75 years and he was just being overly cautious by putting these columns in so like i said i could leave that or i could fix that straight away i don't know i'm gonna i gotta make a decision because these local guys are going to do it for me and uh so the floor would be the first thing and then deciding where the second bathroom is going to go There's a, there's like a, what would be kind of like a great room, or like a living room, I'm going to combine that with what will be the kitchen, and then move that room over to what is a garage right now, and turn the garage into part of the house, because there's no reason to have a garage that's attached to this house, which is, comes with a giant barn, so I'm never going to like put a car or like, it's, this little attachment that's like a garage, is really more like a tool shed, so I'm going to put a proper tool shed on the property and then turn that into part of the actual floor plan.

So, there's a couple things to do. Those are the first things that I'm starting to feel in my gut. Cool. Yeah. 

[00:23:00] Bob: We'll see. For me, um, did I talk about the conduit project last week that I was working on? Yes. 

[00:23:09] Jimmy: You did. You talked about the parts. 

[00:23:12] Bob: Yeah. So, like, 3D printing the parts. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Conduit. So, I've been doing more of that.

Today, we're going to finish it up and do all the assembly. But, it's really... It's really fun to keep going on that idea, and keep coming up with like, now that I've got this, you know, basically I have a snap part that goes around the conduit, so then you can add anything you want to it, like this one is a spike, it's a ground spike, and, um, I've made that from the same kind of clip, I've made pieces that'll insert, so I can put two pieces together at an angle, I've got hinges, I've got Like, loops.

I've got all sorts of little doodads that all fit into the same conduit. And, I'm only make, I'm only like designing the pieces that I need for this particular project I'm working on right now. But then Anthony's taking the same base pieces and making a totally different project. It's like, uh, some light stands and things like that.

But it's, it's been really fun to just be like, oh, I need, I need this slight variation on... The one that I did and I can just copy the model over change one little piece and print it out And then I've got like a new fitting that works perfectly. I've already Adjusted the fits. I've already adjusted the tolerances and all that type of stuff and I don't know It's really cool to have a little system of things.

So now I'm Go ahead. 

[00:24:32] David: It looks like a kit that I would love to buy. Have you thought about making it an actual product? 

[00:24:38] Bob: Uh Kind of. I, I'm, I'm hesitant on, on physical products now. Yeah, 

[00:24:44] David: I feel you on that. But I could see that at Home Depot, just a kit and it has all, you know, four different pieces and multiples of each one and then you can, I mean, you see, you see people make shelves and fixtures and stuff with like the iron pipes.

This is even easier than that. 

[00:25:04] Bob: Yeah, yeah, it's cheaper too. I mean, I was looking at the cost of conduit versus iron pipe. You know, it's not obviously going to have the same strength, but it doesn't need to in most situations. But it's about a dollar a foot at Lowe's and Home Depot. So that's a pretty cheap metal pipe that's paintable, it's weldable, bendable, if you really wanted to.

You can get the pipe benders and yeah, you can. Yeah, sure. I mean, I'm going to be doing that for this one. Um, so maybe. We might also just create a, like a package of the files to where you could print them out. And that way you could print them at different densities depending on what you're doing with it.

You know, if you need them to be solid, that's going to take a long time to print, but they would be pretty strong. Um, but like these pieces that are a spike that's going into the ground doesn't need to be solid. It just needs to be strong enough to go into the dirt to hold the thing down. So 

[00:25:58] David: is it, um, is it one of those things that if you're welding, you have to.

It 

[00:26:05] Bob: depends on, I'm not sure if this stuff has the zinc coating or not, um, it might. But one thing I did in the past, it might have been for this stuff, I don't remember, I made a big, um, PVC. A tube, and I filled it up with vinegar, I think, and then you just drop the pipe in it and let it soak for a certain amount of time, and it eats that layer off, pull it out, and you're good to go, you know, and then you have raw metal, so you got to treat it like it's raw metal after that, but, so I have this tube of, like, de galvanization juice, and I just drop pieces in.

Sugar free. 

[00:26:42] David: It's organic. Gluten free. 

[00:26:42] Bob: Yeah, so, anyway, it's been really fun to just keep coming up with new ideas. I keep combining all the things. I'm like, yeah, I need a hinge. Oh, but the hinge needs to have a spike on it. But then the left hinge needs to have the spike on one side and the right hinge needs to have it on the other side.

So I just have all these weird little variations of these pieces and, um, anyway. 

[00:27:05] Jimmy: Is this something you would ever put on Thingiverse? 

[00:27:07] Bob: Yeah, possibly. I mean, I think we could probably, we could either, like, release the files or we could make a useful set of them and sell them so that somebody could, Get them and then print out as many as they want for, you know, in one place that we could continually update.

If we needed to adjust something or if we needed to whatever, we would have control over the people that bought them, letting them know that there was a new version that they could get, you know, something, so. Yep. I don't know. We'll talk about that. But, you know, Anthony has an idea that he's going to make with the system and then Josh is working on an idea.

I don't know what he's come up with yet, but. Um, so we're trying to figure out how to make the video, and I don't know if I talked about this last week or not. I don't remember. Trying to figure out how to make the video about, I had a project idea, and then it turned into a little bit broader of an idea about a material.

And so I'm still going to make that project, but the video, like, went more into... How do you take a common material and expand it, make it more usable, you know? So, not exactly sure how we're going to voice that, but we'll see. We're going to shoot it today, so. Anyway, I'm excited about that. I've also been working with my oldest son, um, in kind of an interesting way.

A lot of people assume that my kids make stuff all the time, because I do, and they don't. And a lot of that is just scheduling. Like, it's really hard for me to... Work all day, and then their schedules are so crazy for us to find an additional overlap time when somebody has an idea and I have time and materials to make the thing.

You know what I mean? So we don't, we don't like do family make sessions like you would expect. I wish we did, but he, uh, came home and he was in his art class. He's in high school. And his art class, they were... Um, tasked with making a three D object out of two D shapes. And so doing like the, remember like the kits, the little wooden balsa kits you had when you were a kid where everything was like, had slots and you would just snap 'em together, dinosaurs and animals and stuff like that.

So they basically had to do that with something that they like or, you know, some, some shape or whatever. And so he drew out a dinosaur. And started in two dimensions and started trying to figure out how to cut this out of cardboard to put the thing together. And so we started talking about like, well, you know, you, you have to make the slots the same size as the material.

And then I was like, the laser would be the better way to do this. And so he asked his teacher if he could do it with the laser instead of with cardboard and he got approval for that. So the last couple of days we've been working on. Taking his drawings and I showed him how to... Scan those, bring them into Illustrator, turn them into vectors.

I had a big long explanation about the difference between vector and raster. And, it's really funny because, that type of stuff, for us, because we've been in it for so long. If I say raster in a raster image, both of you know exactly what I'm talking about. Versus a vector image. I said that to him and he was like, I don't know what that word is.

What are you talking about? So I got to do like kind of a deep dive on, let's look at a bitmap image really closely so that you see what a pixel actually is. And he's like, whoa, it's made of a bunch of dots, . I'm like, yeah, but there's no reason that he should have known that. So I, you know, it's been really fun because I've gotten to teach him some of the stuff about images that I know, and then how to use basic illustrator stuff and how to take that, put it in the laser software, how to cut it out.

Uh, so he's run the laser a little bit. And I know this is stuff that a lot of people do with their kids all the time. Seems like I would, we just don't have a chance to. And so this has been really fun the last couple days to start, you know, preparing his drawings for this project, and I'm making him do all the computer work, and making him do all the laser stuff, and I'm helping him along with it.

But, uh, we have a couple more days on getting all the pieces to match up, getting all the little joints to work, and then cutting the final pieces out, and then he's gonna paint it and stuff for his art class. That's been really fun. It's been something new for us. It's a great learning experience. Yeah, and I'm hoping it will give him a, kind of a, a different perspective on using the tools.

Cause I don't think he, originally he asked me, can we cut these out on the bandsaw? Cause we have used the bandsaw together before. And I was like, well yeah, I mean we certainly, you know, you can, you've done that before. But, the laser would actually make it fit better. And he was like, oh, okay, well how do we do that?

And so that was a, it was a different path, you know, to learn stuff on. Which was kind of cool. Um, so hopefully that'll, that'll lead to something else. He's also interested in, in uh, coding, like, mods for games. And so I've been trying to figure out how to, how to make that something that he can do without, like, Programming 101.

Let's start at the beginning. And now your dad's gonna teach you how to program, because that's probably not... It's what he needs, but it's probably not what he wants. You know what I mean? So, um, I'm trying to use this stuff as a way to, like, get him to have an appetite for, how do I use software to do the thing that I want to do?

And then that will lead to, how do I... Use code to make software to do the thing that I want to do, I think, so. I'm looking at some different, like, online courses for, um, game modding programming, specifically that, because he has an interest there, so I'm trying to draw him in with that, so. It's been, it's been pretty cool.

We've been working on some stuff together that we don't normally get to do. And he's the one kid that doesn't play soccer. Everybody else is at soccer practice all the time, and a couple of nights a week, it's just he and I at home. And so it's a perfect time for us to spend time together, and... Put that time into that, which is pretty cool.

Uh, so we've been doing that. And then I had a call the other day with a team over at Avid, um, Avid CNC. I don't know if I told you this or not, but. I've been talking to them for a while about getting a plasma CNC, and so we like, we had the conversation, it's, it's done, I have a bunch of cool ideas for it and everything, and so next up we're just doing the ordering process to get that here, and I'm making a space for it in the shop, um, I've got a couple really fun ideas for projects, but I'm really excited about having that, and I think like, we talked a few months ago, maybe at the beginning of the year, about Trying to step out, for me, trying to step out of that, like, I want to make everything accessible all the time.

And I would, I would be hesitant of using 3D printing as much as I'm using 3D printing in this particular project. But this, the Plasma CNC is like, that's a whole nother level of, it's past getting a CNC at home. It's past getting a Plasma cutter at home. It's like, it, you know, a whole different level of...

thing that a lot of people don't have so to show them using it has been like something I would try to avoid but letting myself off the hook there a little bit and trying to use the things at my disposal opened me up to oh I have a bunch of cool ideas that I could actually do if I had a plasma table So, I should just do that.

So, I'm pretty excited about, you know, what we can make with that 

[00:34:29] Jimmy: going forward. You know my opinion, I say use it all. People will be inspired. I think you're right. People, more often than you realize, people will be interested. I mean, we all voyeuristically watch factory videos and car races and stuff, you know, things that we can't afford.

The problem 

[00:34:46] David: is, we have a past. I'll talk about myself. I have a past of doing accessible, budget friendly things. So when I don't do accessible, budget friendly things now, I will get the comments saying, you've changed. I got one the other day that just... They were just... It hit me hard saying, You forgot where you came from.

I used to watch you when you were a drunken woodworker. And now you're using tools that nobody can afford. And I tried to... Explain like this. I there's 200 other woodworking channels that do amazing beginner DIY budget friendly stuff. Go watch them because when I I, when I do it, people don't watch, so I am doing, I'm focused more on creative now.

I have moved past that and that's not going to be for everybody. So um, yeah, the problem is I didn't start off with crazy tools. I started off on budget friendly stuff and people see this change and it rubs some people the wrong way, but it's rubbed a lot of people the right way and I'm having the time of my life now and I'm, I've never had more fun.

Then right now, 

[00:35:58] Bob: yeah, well, and it's really easy as a consumer. And I think we can all do this in the things that we consume is to want them to not change because we like how it started, right? Like the Mandalorian season one was awesome and I don't want that to change, but it's changing and has to change.

Why wouldn't it change? It doesn't make any sense to make season two and through 90 exactly the same as season one. So, like, I can't expect that process. Over there not to change. And I, I think when you're talking even about an individual, would somebody really want you not to progress as a person, as a creative, to keep doing the same thing just because that's how they started watching you?

I mean, I get the impulse, but when you think about it at a personal level, like that's, that's kind of terrible to want somebody to only be what they've been, right? You want people to be more than what they've been, so. Uh, 

[00:36:51] Jimmy: this reminds me of something that's kind of a bug up my butt about, you listen to podcasts and you listen to people talk and you go, uh, this is a simple woodworking project.

Now let me just go to my 300, 000 CNC machine. This extreme meme, and there's certain people that constantly say this on their podcast where they go, oh, let me just go to my 300, 000 CNC machine to show you how I do this. I didn't pay for my 30, 000 CNC machine, I earned it by making good content, and then that company gave it to me.

So there you go. That's a little... To the people that constantly keep saying... Let me just go to... So that basically means everybody has the opportunity to get a 300, 000 CNC machine. If you work hard. I didn't pay for it. I'm saying that right now. I developed a partnership with them. I was like, Hey, do you guys want to give me a CNC machine and I'll show it off on my popular YouTube channel that I built from the ground up by myself?

They said, yeah, please, please do. So, all these people that I go, Let me 300, 000 CNC machine. I'm imitating the imitation of the imitation. That some people might recognize. It drives me crazy when people say, Oh, this is a simple woodworking channel. Let me go to my laser. This is life. It's like the difference between, uh, Oh, look at that fancy car you got.

I'm just going to stick to my horse and cow. It's like, give me a break. This is evolution. This is the world is changing. It's the way it's going. If I have the opportunity to get it, I'm not going to keep myself down simply because I feel some sort of shame for not being able to get a machine, whether I earn it by just doing good content or physically able to pay for it.

Shouldn't feel shame in the slightest bit. Hmm. I'm not a channel that's saying, I'm a simple DIYer. I'm only going to take every single thing to a certain level because that's the cap I put on myself. Then I'm restricting my own growth. I can't go to computer stuff. I can't work on laser stuff. I have to only buy second hand tools.

I only have to buy Ryobi tools. I've never put that cap on myself, ever, for the slightest bit. So, when people constantly go, Ooh, let me show you a simple woodworking project. Let me go to my 300, 000 CNC machine. It drives me crazy. It just, it's like, I have a small mind, and I'm going to, I'm going to expose my small mind to all of you.

It's, it, it, I think it's... It drives me crazy. That's all I'm going to say. 

[00:39:20] Bob: When people think like that. Yeah, David, I think you hit the nail on the head, though. It's like, that attitude is, this is where you came from. You've done a lot of this in the past. This is how I, as a consumer, know you. Here, you've changed.

It should continue to be that way. Again, I think that's valid. I think it's understandable. I just don't think it's right. Everybody 

[00:39:40] Jimmy: has the opportunity to grow and expand. 

[00:39:42] Bob: Sure, and I would hope that anybody that would watch, that came in to our content through, with one set of skills, one set of tools, I would hope that that person would outgrow us.

I hope, for their sake, not for me, I hope that they do things enough to where they go, I should get a bigger tool, a better tool, a different tool, I should, I should try a new thing, you know, that I've never seen anybody else do or 

[00:40:05] Jimmy: whatever, so. If it's someone to get turned off, or for other YouTubers to get turned off, other people watching each other, to get turned off by somebody using a 300, 000 CNC machine for one video, or for two videos, versus You know, just making something simple, like a handmade leather wallet.

That just happens to be what I'm making and I'm not personalizing this. I think it's just a small, narrow minded view that a lot of people keep bringing up. The idea that, okay, I have a laser cutter. Okay, I also have a 100, 000 truck. Okay, it doesn't mean that I'm some fancy pants. I'm just somebody that likes good tools and I earn them and I get them.

I like tools that make my life easier and expand my problem solving capability. And... I shouldn't be ashamed of that. 

[00:40:51] David: Yeah, Mark Spagnuolo, the other day, maybe on his Facebook, maybe his personal Facebook, I don't remember, but, uh, it was something like, uh, he was highlighting a comment of like, you, you don't do...

Budget friendly DIY projects anymore. And he pointed out, like, from day one, I've always had this massive joiner. This ma like, I've always done this, right? And so people are just looking for a reason to complain, I think. But when I started out, there was maybe ten people doing weekly. Woodworking videos.

Now, there's got to be 200 people doing weekly woodworking videos. There's so much, there's so much to choose from. There's something out there for absolutely everybody. And that allows me to do what I want to do now. It's like, you have so much choice. 

[00:41:48] Bob: Yeah, I think, back to the original, like, thing I was bringing up around this.

I think I've found a lot of freedom in 3D printing. It's so stupid when I think about it. I've had a 3D printer in my house. Basically the entire time I've been on YouTube, like I got the first one as a Kickstarter that I saw, you know, it was like a long, long time ago, and I've always avoided using them unless I, they were the only reasonable 

[00:42:15] Jimmy: solution.

3D printers cost as much as a regular computer printer. 

[00:42:19] Bob: Yeah, yeah, they're so cheap now, it's ridiculous, but I've found so much freedom recently in just what everybody else has already been doing for ten years, in that like, Oh, uh, a simple solution would be to model this in 10 minutes, let it print while I go to bed and then it's done in the morning.

It's like, I don't know, I mean, I'm, I'm enjoying it and I, I, the only reason I bring this up is just to say that freedom, that additional capacity has allowed me to make my desk as covered in these fittings that I didn't have to mill that are very specific that can change and iterate quicker than... You know, like, anything else, any other process, and it's, it's just, I like the freedom of having an accessible tool that, that is that, and I want other people to, to look at the possibility rather than like the Well, I can't, you know, that attitude of I can't, I don't have, I don't wanna, I, like I get it, I understand that, and we try to still do things across the border.

I'm not complaining about anything, by the way. Sounds like I'm complaining. I'm trying to say, this is really fun. I'm enjoying it. I want other people to enjoy it as well. It's obvious that it's 

[00:43:31] David: rewarding to you when you, when you show them off. And how, how, because it's a really cool thing, we happen to have a job that I think the reason we work so much and the reason we want to work so much is because the work to reward is, that, that ratio is pretty great.

Like, uh, and we get instant reward with, you know, when we release a video and you get views and feedback and stuff. But I want to watch, because that's so rewarding for you, I want to watch videos where you are excited, where you are rewarded, because that's a, that's a reward for me. It's, it's entertaining.

It's, it's like watching a Smarter Every Day video. I watch them because Destin is so excited about everything he's doing that all of a sudden I'm excited. about the way water flows out of a hose. What? Like, I wouldn't, right? Yeah. 

[00:44:22] Bob: Yeah, for sure. Well, anyway, I'm, I'm excited about the plasma table too. That was, I guess, how I actually started talking about it.

There's a whole new world of possibility there. Uh, and not something I would expect a lot of people to have or necessarily even want, you know, it is kind of a specialty thing, but knowing that that's on its way. Has led my brain to go, okay, well, how could I use that? How can I, you know, how can I, what else can I come up with that I wouldn't have been able to do otherwise?

Because I think that's where it really shines, is, is, what is it, what can it uniquely make? Not uniquely, but, you know, make it a lot easier to make than, than just like, cutting something by hand or, I don't know. So, I'm pretty excited about all that stuff that's, that's coming in. Uh, video coming out this week for us is...

Actually, one that I had very little to do with. I mean, I helped with it, but, um, Josh has a couple little boys, and, young boys, and they share a room, and so he's been designing, um, like loft beds for them to take, to share a small space, and use it so they have their own individual space within this one room.

And so he came up with a whole, uh, loft bed system, and then we, like, brainstormed some other variations of it. So we built this loft bed, and it looks really good, like really good. Very, very simple to build. We intentionally went the simple route with like, How can we minimize tools? How can we make it as accessible as possible?

Somebody in an apartment who might need a loft bed, What would they, you know, what tools would they have at their disposal? Things like that. So, the video is about us building that bed. He did the majority of the work. I did a bunch of edge banding and, you know, helped assembly and stuff. But... So that's been kind of an interesting thing for a furniture project to happen mostly without me while I've been working on other stuff.

And we got to use our AR model system that we have for, like he modeled the bed and then we just held up the phone in the room and showed the model, like the bed, where it's going to be in the room. Make sure it fit and everything. Oh, that's cool. That's an app you could do. Yeah, it's a thing that we've been doing with our plans so that somebody can go to our website and there's a QR code and so they can, before they buy the plans, they can take a picture of the QR code, it opens the model on their phone and they can see it in their space.

That's 

[00:46:52] Jimmy: too fancy for me, by the way, I'm feeling offended. I don't have 

[00:46:57] Bob: that app on my phone. Yeah, you do, actually. You absolutely do. You don't need an app. Well, I'm too 

[00:47:01] Jimmy: insecure to go look for it. I just want to complain. Okay, that's, hmm, you're lost. Let me open my, let me open my iPhone, sorry. 

[00:47:08] Bob: So anyway, this video is pretty cool because we can't, it's the future, man.

So we came up with three variations of this bed. Three different, like, it's a bed up top and different things down bottom. So they all have plans, they all have QR codes so you can check them out. So I'm excited about that because it's a, it's an accessible thing but it's also, there's variation so it can work with different people, you know.

It's pretty cool. Um, I think that's kind of what I've been doing, uh, pretty much. We have been talking for almost an hour and we haven't even gotten to the topic. We did kind of have a topic. Did we have a topic? We kind of did. David, you were, I mean, you kind of already mentioned that your stuff has been doing well, like better than, than it has been lately.

And I was really curious why, if you knew why, or... It's, um, 

[00:47:59] David: so, yeah, I mean, I've, uh, I think I mentioned earlier, I stopped making videos, I stopped making the videos that I thought I should make, and I started making the videos that I wanted to make, and for me, for what I do, it's like, I want people to watch any video that I put out because they like watching me.

And so, and I understand, when you make personality based videos, that you're going to, there's going to, there's going to be a bunch of people who don't like your personality and don't watch them, and there's going to be a bunch of people that do like your personality and will watch anything, and so, I'm working more towards that.

It's more about, um, just letting go and doing what I want, but I also approach the videos a little bit different, um, where I'm thinking, like, Well, because this is a business, uh, you know, I, I, I think of like, is this YouTubable? So I have to build, I have to build a cabinet for our new laundry room. But I don't want to do a how to build a cabinet for a laundry room.

So now I'm challenging myself. How can I turn this? How can I make this YouTubable? What, what is interesting about me making this cabinet for this laundry room? What is the, and so maybe the focus won't be how to, the focus will be the challenges of designing. I haven't figured that out yet, but now I approach everything different.

Like what? is the title of this video before I start. What is the thumbnail of this video before I start? Why would somebody watch this video? And one of the questions I ask myself is, is this video capable of getting a million views? And my videos typically don't. I've only have a few that have over a million views.

Um, but I'm trying to think like that now, like, and so I'm, I'm thinking bigger. And if you're looking to get into content, You have to, um, content creation, you just have to look at it and think, what, what is my purpose? What is, what is the goal? Who is going to watch these videos and make videos that are for that particular audience?

So, I just kind of approach things different now. Yeah. I took, um... I think we've been... Oh, go ahead. Go ahead. I was gonna say, I, um, I had a class with, or a course with Daryl Eves last fall. And that kind of opened me up to what analytics I should be looking at. Like, the, the course in a few sentences is basically if you want to get into content creation and you want to make something, you want to have a successful YouTube channel.

It's all about click through rate, what percentages of people... Uh, see that, see that thumbnail, and how many clicked through, what's the percentage of that, and then the average view duration, uh, how long are they watching the video, are they watching past 50 percent of the video on average? If so, you know, that's good, or below, and then you're looking for where people drop off and you're, you're making adjustments.

So a little bit of playing the analytics game. But then there's this... What's, what's the reason for your channel? What's the, what's the story? He calls them buckets. So, I want to have four different types of videos, and four different buckets. So, maybe one of the buckets is taking something old, and making it new.

And then, another bucket is taking something new, and modding it. And then there's another bucket of, maybe it's a tool, Tool review, new tool. Like, so I have these four different buckets and I alternate between those buckets, but the buckets are all kind of titled within the same like you woodworker takes Goodwill whatever and then that's so all of those videos within that bucket are kind of have a similar title and Then so when one video ends YouTube knows to recommend the next video within that that bucket and so That's basically the course in a nutshell, but it's kind of caused me to think a little bit different.

And then I'm doing another course here next month with a, with a different. Guys, so Daryl Eves is like, he's like um, Mr. Beast's analytics guy, and has his own course. And it's expensive, it's stupid expensive, but for me it's, it's what I do, it's worth it. And then there's this other guy named Patty Galloway, and I'm taking his course next month, and I think it's more focused on programming, and not the analytics stuff.

So I want to see how his course compares too. But um, And I can't speak to anything about Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. I do terrible on those, and I just don't spend a lot of time there. But I am, I'm just energized right now because I'm, I'm just having fun making the videos. I've, I've never had, I've never enjoyed making videos more than, than right now.

Because I've, I've let go and I'm not doing the how to stuff. And I'm, you know, taking a gamble on myself, paying for an expensive course and then getting rid of the how to's, which is alienating some of the eye on it. That's a, that's a, that's a risk, but it's, it's paying off. 

[00:53:14] Bob: And there's also like, there's a turnover time in a transition like that, you know, where you're going to have.

For a while, you're going to have people who have the, the mentality that you were talking about of you used to be this and now you're not, but eventually, those people will either adjust to the new normal or they'll stop watching and then the people that have come on since then won't really have that, that like, context for you anymore.

So, I mean, making a change like that is totally reasonable, it just, there will be some growing pains to it for a while. But, you know, we've had that too. I mean, we've had, from when I went from voiceovers to non voiceovers. When I went to, you know, basic tools to adding more digital tools. When it went from me to me and other people.

Like, we've had a lot of those things. But there's always two sides to that. Some people, I love the new thing you're doing. I don't like the thing that you're doing. You know, it's, it's like we'll have comments next to each other, literally next to each other, that say, I hate your music. The next one is, this music is so awesome.

Oh, I get that. That right there is proof to me that, like, you can only take it for, you know, a 

[00:54:18] Jimmy: little bit. The one I love the most is, I'm so glad to see you're posting videos again. 

[00:54:22] David: Oh, boy. 

[00:54:24] Jimmy: What? I've consistently posted videos for 11 years. I never have stopped. There's never been more than, like, a month that I did not have a video posted.

It's really good to see you posting videos again. I really miss your work. 

[00:54:35] Bob: You should just be like, I'm glad to be back. Well, the reason I was asking, David, about all of that stuff is because, you know, beforehand, we were, before we started recording, we talked a little bit about that, and you thought it might be too inside baseball.

But, I still get comments, or I get questions from people, emails and stuff, and I'm sure you all do, too, about like, you know, you all inspired me to start a channel, now I, now I'm getting started, do you have any, Tips or tricks or advice for somebody getting started. And so I know that there's an appetite out there for people who are trying to figure this out today.

How to get started. We don't have, I don't know if it's the luxury or the curse of having to start our jobs today. We already did that. We started it in a very different landscape. And so it's, a lot of times it's kind of hard for me to have a really useful thing to tell them other than just like, you gotta do it until you either don't care about it anymore or it works.

I mean, it's kind of like the... It's like with anything, you know, you just gotta work at it until you're tired of it or you've made some progress. But getting started in content creation today as a, as a, as a path to a career. I, I don't have a lot of helpful things to tell them. So I was curious, from your recent success, things like you just said, you know, are those applicable to someone who's getting started?

[00:55:55] David: Yeah, I, I mean, first, the first thing you have to decide is what type of audience do you want. So, um, I've got a list of like seven channels, and they're like, how to be a YouTuber type channels, uh, and we'll put them in the show notes. But. Some of these are for very beginners. Some of these are more advanced.

I watched them all because I always want to be kind of up to date. So I'll, I'll, I'll list these seven channels in the show notes. Um, shoot, I was going somewhere with that. Uh, but I, but I don't remember anyway, I'll have, I'll have a, um, it's kind of like a, every once in a while I'll get somebody to ask, like, what do I.

Where do I, where do I start? Like, do you have any advice for me? And I don't give any personal advice, I just say go watch these channels. Oh, where I was going with that is, if you want to be a content creator, you can't just watch a make something video or watch I like to make stuff videos and then just try to imitate what they're doing.

You really have to study it, like you have to, like I study YouTube like, like somebody is studying to be a lawyer, like I, and you continually study, at least I do, like I am addicted to membership tutorial websites, uh, books, and I just, I'm a, I'm a student always, and I'm just, You have to want it. You really have to want to spend the time studying.

So, check out the channels that we'll list in the description. Cool. 

[00:57:35] Bob: Any other thoughts on this? Jimmy, you got anything? 

[00:57:38] Jimmy: Well, it's funny. I'll talk about when we went to WorkbenchCon. I met some people and, uh, it seemed to be the conversation there more often than not was not necessarily about the content, but more about the The title and the thumbnail and just getting the click.

You know, the content is almost, I hate to say irrelevant, but obviously you need something that's engaging. But the whole conversation and some of these younger guys are being more successful with interesting titles. Like you'll notice in my channel, if anybody's paying close attention, I'm starting to abandon having my name in the title.

In the thumbnail, my name and the title. And you know, that was a big change for me because in the beginning everything seemed to work and I just want my content to be branded so it didn't get stolen. And now I'm letting go of that because what's more important is just staying relevant. And so I am getting rid of that and I'm going to recommend Drew Witt Drew Witt from Drew Witt Woodworks for my recommendation but he and I met at WorkbenchCon.

And he's been giving me some really good advice on, on just going forward with titles and for instance, this last video, he titled that video for me. I texted 

[00:58:46] David: you and I'm like, dude, how's that video doing because the title and thumbnail are fantastic. Yeah. 

[00:58:52] Jimmy: I, I, lately what I've been doing, Drew is like my, he's like my, uh, what, what would you call it?

He's like my golden goose. I send him the video before I do anything, I'm like, what do you think? And he says, I think it should be this and I think it should be that. It's almost like I send it and I'm like, which horse should I bet on? And I, the one before that was a dud, he's like, I'm not sure how many people want to make an egg basket.

He did title that one and it was my 10 of 10, so we joke about that. And then the next one was the model, he did title that and thumbnail that, and it's my most, it's my highest performing video in recent years. Um, so. Drew and I have been going back and forth a lot about what, Dave, what you were talking about.

He studies very deeply. Every day he's sending me a podcast or some other information. He's really, really in the trenches and figuring this, trying to figure this out. He's got some very successful videos, and then some videos that don't do extremely well, and not because they're bad, but because, you know, he might have swing and a miss on the title or the thumbnail, but he's really, really working hard on trying to figure that out.

And he talks to a lot of the guys that are very successful, and they all have this conversation about thumbnails and titles and thumbnails and titles. You know, it's not just a slick picture. Like, I think he said to me, or somebody said to me, like, if Drew didn't title it, what would you have titled it? It would have been, Scale Model of My Shop in a Picture.

Which isn't enough. Unfortunately, it has to be a question, or it has to be some sort of intriguing, like, you know, uh, you know, everyone jokes about the the face, like, hold it in your face, like, I messed up big this time, you know, that stupid meme. In a way, it has to be that, but in a subtle, more, in a, in a, in a more, um, Subtle way.

What is that when advertising tries to trick you without you knowing it? What is that called? Subtle or surreptitious is like a certain word for it. Subconscious? Anyway, you have to come up with a title that piques somebody's interest to click. For your 

[01:00:47] David: particular audience. So the shock face thing doesn't really work with...

The DIY woodworking. I've never done that, but it really, it really doesn't. But it works with like, if you're making a Mr. Beast type video. 

[01:01:01] Jimmy: I just came up, I just thought of a word. It's not clickbait, it's trickbait. 

[01:01:05] David: It's not clickbait if you deliver on the promise. Yeah, 

[01:01:09] Jimmy: well, that's what I'm saying. It's not clickbait, it's trickbait.

I just coined the term. From now on, everyone's going to use the word trickbait instead of clickbait. Because you're, in a way, it's like you're tricking the audience. Like, well, it was Drew's idea to title my video. I'm building a model to make a 100, 000 decision, which is inherent and it's there. I didn't think for one second about it consciously because...

All in my mind is like, I'm making a model, I'm making a model. I'll spend that money when I can, when I have to. But I completely put it out of my mind because I don't want to have to feel the pain of that. But to bring it up and put it forefront brings the anxiety to everybody that's watching. It's like, oh, it's a lot of money.

And in my mind, it's the anxiety. It's obviously nobody wants to spend that much money. So I just... Push it down. I pushed those feelings down and I would never have put it in the title unless Drew suggested it. And I think it's part of a big reason why the video is doing well. MrBeast 

[01:02:01] David: said, like we're going a little, a little long, but I actually love talking about this stuff, but I was hesitant to talk about it.

But MrBeast says, replaced the word, um, algorithm with audience just stop making videos for the algorithm and make videos for the audience and that's really really good advice because the all the algorithm is trying to do is put you in front of the right people And like what Jimmy is saying is you can make the best video in the world, but if you can't get people to click on that, on that title or that thumbnail, it doesn't, doesn't matter that you have the best video in the world.

You got to create some intrigue or some, some interest. There's got to be this, there's got to be, Ooh, I have to watch that video. Yeah. You got to make clickbait. That's what I'm trying to say. Trick bait. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 

[01:02:54] Bob: Yeah. Cool. Well, um, ever 

[01:03:00] Jimmy: changing landscape of YouTube. Yeah. It's fun. It's challenging.

It's easy for you to say people give you free tools. 

[01:03:09] Bob: I'm gonna thank our Patreon supporters because they make it so that we don't have to worry about all of the YouTube stuff on our podcast. We just get to make a podcast. That's it. And it's purely based on our Patreon supporters and I'm being absolutely serious there isn't like no sarcasm at all.

They make it so that we can just get together, talk about this stuff, hang out, and we don't have to worry about, you know, titling and creating a thumbnail for this podcast to get people's attention, we just get to do it. So, it really does mean a lot that people support us on Patreon. Um, and we always do the after show for all of them, no matter the level that they support.

Uh, so it's a separate podcast feed that you get through Patreon. It's more show after this show. So we're going to go do that right after this, but I want to thank our top supporters cause they go well above and beyond, uh, to help us out. That's Corey Ward, Albers Woodworks, Works by Solo, Chad from ManCrafting, Chad's Custom Creations, Grant at DadCrafted, Rich at Low End Designs, Odin Leather Goods.

There's a lot of people, and we are seriously grateful, uh, for it. So, if you want to get the after show, if you want to join that group, um, and help us out, you can go to patreon.

com slash makingit. We always have a couple people join up, you know, uh, throughout the month, and really grateful for that additional support, so go check it out, if you want to. Either way, we're just glad you're listening. What do you have to recommend? Well, 

[01:04:44] David: before I get into my pick, I want to say one more thing.

Um, and I think this is interesting. One of my, the channels that I'm listing in the seven channels, a channel called Colin and Samir. And they seem, they mentioned something a couple weeks ago, like, they see this trend. where high production, very well produced videos are, uh, might not be the future. There's, there's this like, they, they see DIY more real, more not super produced videos starting to get this, this upswing.

So if you're just starting out, don't think you have to be. Perfect lighting, perfect audio, 15 cameras or whatever. Just shoot what you want to shoot. Just look at my videos, 

[01:05:34] Jimmy: 42 color temperatures in the same shot. Just look at 

[01:05:36] David: Jimmy's videos. So, um, it's interesting if this, to see if the overly produced, I'm guilty of that for sure, videos Start to go down and it's more more DIY.

But anyway, my pick is and I picked this channel before it's JHS pedals the So it's a basically it's a boutique guitar pedal company, but their channel is It is absolutely phenomenal. It's like a master course in being a small business while supporting the entire community of like businesses. So, this YouTube channel...

Uh, the host, the owner of the company, Josh, his, he, his personality is, I love it. It's just like this super dry humor, but he's always highlighting other pedal companies. So most of his videos are not pushing his own products. They're, they're, he's pushing other companies, products, um, even big one, big ones, you know, um.

Boss and and all the other huge guitar pedal makers down to the little boutique ones but It's really good content like They've YouTube ified the pedal industry and he he's got such a great personality That they're not he's not just showing you how to use a pedal or what pedals are trendy or or whatever.

I'm just like I'm super in and into all their videos and he's being asked on so many other YouTube channels. I'm seeing him on Reverb and on Sweetwater just because he's got a good host. So it's like a masterclass if you want to have a small business of how to support, not be competitive with your competitors, but bring up the entire industry and, and, and highlight everybody.

It's just, it's wholesome. 

[01:07:32] Bob: That's cool. I know of the pedals, but I don't guess I've ever actually seen them. The 

[01:07:37] David: YouTube channel is so good. Awesome. 

[01:07:42] Jimmy: Er, uh, I was gonna, uh, yeah, I'm gonna, me and Wit have been talking about, me and Drew Wit have been talking a lot, and, uh, I'm just gonna shout out Drew Wit from Wit Woodworks.

He's got a small channel, but he's grown fast, and he's really figuring out, like I said, the subtle details, and he really digs into the deep, the small, little details that I just don't pay attention to, so that's why we've been having a really... Interesting dialogue about what makes a good title, and everything else in just the whole platform.

So check out Drew. From Wickwoodworks. He does tool reviews and a lot of shop stuff. Cool. 

[01:08:22] Bob: Uh, mine is a channel that is, uh, I ran across it by accident, kinda. I was looking for rewiring car stuff, and I found a video by SuperfastMatt. SuperfastMatt. You have? Yeah, he's, he's really interesting. I've only watched a couple of videos, but he has a very kind of dry delivery, like not, dry is the wrong word.

Matter of fact, maybe that's a good way to say it. Seems to know a lot and, um, is really good at like taking a bunch of information and just laying it out there. And his delivery is just like, there's a little bit of snark in it here and there. And, um. But, he, a lot of coverage on the thing. So, like, in the video I was watching about rewiring the car, like, he goes through explaining how to rewire a car completely.

And, along the way, it's, there's just some funny little, like, I don't know, you just have to go watch it. It's all car stuff, he does a lot of, like, upgrades, and, um, yeah, just lots of car stuff. But, I'm enjoying it. So, only seen a couple, 

[01:09:29] David: definitely see more. I think I know about this channel from you. I thought you, I think you recommended this channel before.

I don't think I've ever seen it before. Um, yeah, it's, it's good. It's a good recommendation. Yeah. 

[01:09:41] Bob: Uh, yeah, so go check that one out if you're into cars. And if not, maybe don't. 

[01:09:45] David: That's weird. I'm into cars, but I'm also not into cars. I'm not, I'm not a car guy, but I, but I 

[01:09:51] Bob: am. Yeah. I'm into certain cars. That's what I found is that I think the blanket term of like car guy.

Whoa. Whoa. Oh 

[01:10:00] Jimmy: my. I unmuted myself. The 

[01:10:05] David: first time I tried to ignore it, but I, I don't know, I just kept talking and, uh, 

[01:10:10] Jimmy: but it's hard to do. I'm so sorry. I keep, I, I'm having like the most congested life right now, and I'm like muting, unmuting. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I existed. Oh, boy. 

[01:10:20] Bob: We're going to leave it with that.

Thank you. That's just the best way to end it. Thanks for listening, everybody. We'll talk to you next 

[01:10:25] Jimmy: time. No, no, no. What were you saying? I don't even remember. 

[01:10:28] Bob: Sorry.
