392-Making It
===

[00:00:00] Bob: Have I ever told you guys about my sneezing fits? Yeah, Jimmy has a yawning fit right now. I'm having a yawning fit. Some people are like allergic to stuff and they'll sneeze, you know, if they get around cats or whatever, they'll sneeze a few times and have to go blow their nose and everything. I don't know of anything I'm allergic to.

Like, I took an allergy test years and years ago, so it's probably changed. I don't know of anything specific I'm allergic to, but occasionally something will tickle my nose and I'll start sneezing and I will just keep sneezing. And it just goes on, and on, and on, and it happened this morning, again. Oh boy.

It 

[00:00:36] Jimmy: happens to my brother. He starts going and everyone's like, oh, here we go. 

[00:00:40] Bob: It's terrible. It's like, the worst. Uh, the one that I've counted... I mean, I've counted a few of them, but the highest number I got to was 33. And this is in the course of, yeah, this is in the course of like a minute and a half, two minutes.

Wow. Can 

[00:00:56] Jimmy: you have like a heart attack, sneezing so often? 

[00:00:59] Bob: I have no idea. You can definitely feel like you're going to throw up though, I'll tell you that. Yeah. It is terrible. Anyway, the only reason I'm saying that is because my, I sneezed a bunch this morning and my throat is scratchy because I sneezed so much.

Like that. Oh yeah. You know that. 

[00:01:16] Jimmy: That can happen. Sometimes you try and hold it in and then like it feels like your eyeballs popped out. Yeah. 

[00:01:21] Bob: That's bad. A friend of mine used to always hold in the sneeze and I would always tell him like something bad was gonna... Come out. Somewhere. Eventually, the pressure's got to be released.

But. And then I dated a girl when I was, when I was growing up, when I was in like, high school or middle school or something, and she would do this, this giant buildup to sneezes. Just like, and then go, and that was her sneeze. It was this tiny little bird sneeze. It was hilarious. Anyway, how are you guys doing 

[00:01:49] Jimmy: today?

Oh, good morning. I was gonna say my, my, my 8th grade math teacher encouraged us to hold in our sneezes during class. Really? Oh. Yeah. She said, she, she taught us how to hold in our sneeze and she's like, I encourage you to hold your sneezes in. And she said she went, when she was a kid, and so this was in maybe 1980, 85, 83.

And she, so when she was a kid in the 60s, she said, the teacher said, you have to hold your sneezes in. I always remember that when I hear someone sneeze, I remember Mrs. Goodstein insisting that we try and hold our sneezes in, but it's not mandatory because it's not the religious instruction class that she was in.

She gave us a whole lecture and we were like, okay, you went to uh, medieval school, we didn't, I'm sorry. Medieval school. Anyway, I'm not going to hold my sneezes in, I'll just mute. 

[00:02:36] Bob: Yeah, yeah, well I mean that, like, so, when my kids were really young, all the teachers were just, you know, in your elbow, sneezing your elbow.

And I get that, like, you want to teach a kid not to just sneeze out into the room. Holding it seems like a bad, 

[00:02:49] Jimmy: uh... Yeah, that's what I always thought, I think you blow your eardrums. Anyway, I'm good. I haven't sneezed in a while, but we have like two feet of snow outside, which is nice. Nice and, and let's just, it's so funny when I, I wake up, just like yesterday morning, I wake up and I just, I go, I could just tell by the quietness, because it dampens everything, the snow.

Because I live kind of near the road and I could tell. And I wake up and I could just feel it. And I'm like, Oh, there's a lot of snow out there. And I look outside and it's like a winter one. I made a little video. I've been playing with CapCut on the phone. And so I made a little video of, uh, and it's funny.

I sent it to my friend. I sent it to you guys and my publisher today. I sent it to my, uh, my friend. And she says, it looks like a horror movie. And I'm like, Oh, I didn't even think about that. And so then I. In CapCut, I put like some dramatic music over it. It looks just like the opening of a horror movie in the snow.

It's 

[00:03:44] David: cool. That sound is so, or lack of sound is so unique. And it's just, it's a, it's, it feels. So peaceful and it's just like everything is nice and calm even though the snow is a huge danger to everybody and People die and get hurt because of it all the time, but it's just such a peaceful calm sound 

[00:04:09] Bob: Well, you guys both get snow more than we do on a pretty regular basis Do you 

[00:04:15] David: know what Jimmy's talking about when he says how quiet it is after everything is covered with snow?

Yeah, yeah. There's gotta be a lot of people who don't understand. Yeah, 

[00:04:23] Bob: I mean, we have those moments on occasion, but we don't get that. That much snow on a regular basis. Usually if we get snow, it's just like enough to be annoying. It's not like everything is covered and there's a thick layer. But because you get it so relatively so often, like it, does it cause you any problems anymore?

Does it slow you down? Or is it just like, Oh, it's like, it's raining. 

[00:04:46] Jimmy: For me, it's easy because I live here and I work here. I haven't been working at the shop in town as much because of that. So I have all the facilities right here. So I've been doing that here. We're doing more grungy work down the block, which is not necessarily on a timely basis.

So it's, it's okay with me. I mean, I go a few days now in this weather and I don't even. Move my cars. I just, I'm all completely concealed here at the house. Today I do have to do some errands for the next video, so I will be out and about. If anybody wants to meet me at the Tractor Supply later today. 

[00:05:16] Bob: In the past.

[00:05:18] David: In the past. 

[00:05:18] Jimmy: Tractor Supply meetup. Yeah, no, so I, I do, uh, it doesn't bother me. It's just, it's just one step further away from springtime, which is just a little annoying. You think you're all that? You know, I went and I bought grass seed the other day, thinking I was going to run it around the house. And then I was like, Oh, maybe wait a little bit.

Because I said, when, when do you start putting grass seed down on line? It's like, you know, my zone for like May, end of April, May. And I was like, Oh, wait. And now there's like tons of snow outside. Wow. Yeah. We don't get any sprouts up here. I see it every year now that I've been up here for so long. We don't get buds on the trees typically in a typical regular year until like May 15th.

Like that's when I start to see buds on the trees. That's inside trees right now. Yeah. But because the world is changing so fast, as soon as the snow melts is probably going to be green leaves underneath them. Yeah. 

[00:06:18] David: We have We don't get as much snow as we used to. So when I was a kid, there was basically snow on the ground all winter.

And now it's like, it snows and it melts and it snows and it melts. And sometimes it doesn't free. We don't have long freezes like we used to. And it changes the bug season. So if we don't get a really super deep freeze for three or four weeks, we have a big tick problem in the following summer. Yeah. So there's, it's definitely different.

I. I've always wondered, like, did it just seem like it snowed more as a kid? And then, you know... 

[00:06:56] Jimmy: Everybody says it used to. I remember it used to snow a lot more. 

[00:06:59] David: But, yeah, the local newscast just did a thing of like, we just had our lowest snowfall, our second lowest snowfall for February in recorded history here.

In Northwest Ohio. So, um, yeah, we, we get less snow and it seems to be a little bit more severe. Like maybe we don't have zero degrees for four weeks like we used to, but we'll have negative 15 degrees for four days. So yeah, we get these like extremes. And then it'll be 60 degrees two days later. 

[00:07:30] Bob: So weird.

Last night we did a Maker Alliance hangout with all the people that support I Like To Make Stuff. And, uh, this guy Dan is up north. I can't remember exactly where he's based. Um, but he was like, I think he said that they had, oh, I'm gonna say the wrong numbers now. But it was like, yeah, we've got... You know, 18 inches of snow since yesterday, and they're expecting another 5 or 6 tonight, and like, my sister's had like 4 feet of snow so far this year, and I'm like, what in the world?

Like, where I live would just collapse, like we would not be able to handle that at all. It'd be fun, but we wouldn't be able to handle it. Well what have you guys been working on, anything? 

[00:08:12] David: I'm still working on my goodwill table, just finished it up yesterday, and I think it's I think I'm going to take it back to the Goodwill, um, I think it'll be a good ending to the video.

I was going through the footage, we recorded it at the Goodwill, and the lady working there, she was kind of a, when we picked up the table, she was kind of, um. Grumpy is probably not the right word, but she was a little grumpy and she was like, what are you guys recording? And I was like, I'm just making a YouTube video.

And then my brother, who just couldn't let it go, was like, you want to be in the video? When she was obviously annoyed that we were filming in her Goodwill store and she's like, no. And so I went through the footage and unfortunately the camera was off during that conversation. I was hoping so bad that it wouldn't be in the video.

But um, we've joked about taking it back to the same Goodwill and trying to give it to that lady. But it wouldn't make sense. But I think I'm going to just donate it back to the Goodwill. It's a, um, it's this 80s oak table. I think we just we talked about it last week and basically we we hit all the oak we hit all the 80s we kept removing various 80s layers from this table and and we did it with some new veneers and some shapes and stuff and it came out pretty good i'll send you guys a text where uh we took the we Just veneered over the top and we cut a bunch of hickory and walnut strips and glued them together So it was nice and stripy and then we cut 45s out of that.

So then we made like Brian Pruess has said it looked like a Charlie Brown t shirt So you have these these waves and then we took that Cut it one more time and to a bunch of angles and put it together and you get this Chaotic, weird, crazy pattern. Which I think by the, I think if this podcast comes out on Friday, I think the video will be out on Sunday.

So, if it doesn't make any sense... Just wait a couple days, . 

[00:10:15] Bob: That's cool. Looking forward to seeing that. 

[00:10:19] Jimmy: And I've been working on the boat. I got back on the boat. I didn't do a video last couple of weekends just because it's just been so busy with things and I figured it's no one's gonna miss a video. It's two here or there.

It seems like no one, no one's paying that close attention anymore. Anyway, so I took a couple weekends off and. I've been hitting it hard on Instagram trying to put even not that it seems like it doesn't matter anymore because no one's getting paid I'm not getting paid in any way, but did you guys hear that Meta is not paying people for reels?

Do you guys know the details of that? No. Yeah, Meta's I'm waiting for Philip DeFranco to do the breakdown because he makes it so clear But Meta announced that they're no longer gonna pay people for reels Which is crazy to me, you know, on Facebook. It's not 

[00:11:01] Bob: surprising to me at all, honestly. 

[00:11:04] Jimmy: Some people make their whole living doing that.

They figured out, they've hacked the system to be able to make more, you know, enough money to consider it an income. I know a few people in particular, and now apparently they're not going to do that. So that's got to be a real nice kick in the jewels. I am going to make, uh, so I'm finishing the boat, so I probably have the boat fairly soon.

It's just, I want to take it on the water, so that's, as long as the weather is cooperating, I'll probably have that out by middle of April, and that'll be nice to finish that. And I've been working on this other boat that's a bar, that's also coming to a close, so that's nice. I get my shop floor back in two big areas.

And so this week I'm going to do a video where I'm making some chicken coop accessories. I'm going to make some nesting boxes, and I'm going to make a wire basket.

And I have a few of them, but I always thought it would be cool to make my own and try and figure out some interesting left turns I could bring to it. I don't know how much more interesting you can make a wire basket, but I'm going to find out today. What kind of wire are you using for that? I went to Home Depot last night and the guy was, the guy was sat in the aisle, doing the aisle and I walked up and I saw the bin and I'm like, hmm, eighth inch rod.

And I just put, grabbed the whole bundle and took it out and he just looked at me like. Hmm. That's annoying. Don't make me do my job. Yeah. I took a whole bundle of eighth inch rods, probably about 30 rods of them. I was just like, I'll use these up. I just took them all. So, I got three and four foot rods of eighth inch.

So, it seems a little fancy. It had to have been 

[00:12:38] David: so expensive. It's the worst place to buy 

[00:12:41] Jimmy: that stuff. I know, it's just because it's been a crunch and I don't feel like driving up to Albany to get it. So, I had to buy some other supplies too. All in, I was surprised it was only 200. I bought some electrical supplies too.

So, with everything it was only 200. Which in my mind, I'm like, the cost of producing a video, getting away cheap, you know? So, I'm going to do that and we'll see tomorrow if I actually have it done. Because today's Wednesday and I have all day today and tomorrow and Friday to do it. But no, it's this spring is coming up quick.

I got my passport to travel to Europe. I'm going to Mako Central and then from Mako Central I'm going to Australia. Me and April are going to do some event in Australia. So I traveled to the city for the first time in a year the other day. I didn't tell anybody so now people are gonna hear this and get mad at me.

I snuck in on Amtrak and I snuck right back out on Amtrak. I went and did my passport information. I did my passport interview and I got that done right away. I use a private service, so you don't have to go wait on like a DMV line. And I use a private service, it costs money, but that's why you pay for it.

So you just go into a quiet office, talk to a girl for 10 minutes and leave. And I did that and then I stopped at B&amp; H, which is right near Penn Station in New York City. It's a famous photography shop. And I bought the probe lens. You guys know the long probe? Oh, man. Yeah. 

[00:14:09] David: I've been wanting one forever, but I don't have enough use for it.

Well, I, I, 

[00:14:13] Jimmy: they keep popping up. I keep, cause I looked at one a few months ago online. So they keep popping up. It's like, Hey, you sure? You know, everywhere I go, I open my bathroom mirror and it's like, on my bathroom mirror, it's like, you sure you don't want this? It's crazy the way the ads follow you. So I just went in and the reason I didn't buy it online.

And it's because when you see this two options, there's the regular, and then there's the Cine one. And. Uh, there's the, the, sorry, someone just sent me a message. The Cine one, now if anyone knows anything about this, I learned the Cine one has a gear on it so you can attach a motor so you can focus it as you push and pull if you're going to do a track shot.

I didn't really know that and the guy at the store finally explained it to me and I was like, I don't really need that one. Yeah, so I got the, if you see my Instagram, it's the letter Z was shot with that and my color temperature was off a little bit. I tried to correct it and you know when you try and correct the color temperature everything just goes haywire from there.

Yeah. It looks like you're in a 1960s, uh, rock video because the colors just grouped together. Did you have to add any, 

[00:15:13] David: any lighting to it? I know that it has, it has 

[00:15:16] Jimmy: light at the tip. It has light at the tip. Oh, it does? Yeah. So I think that's why I was having problems with my light. Cause the light at the tip is probably daylight and I had a light bulb and then I have lights above.

So I have like three light sources and they all mix and make some weird mishmash of automatic tone. Yeah. Um, but yeah, so I'm excited to dip into my chicken coop, uh, accessories. I'll start right after we get off today. But I, just a little bit about the rowboat. I got to a block in the rowboat where I just, I got to a point where I had so many details that I had to work out.

And this is really where the rubber meets the road when you make a boat. Because there's level lines and compound curves and things that just don't fit unless you sand them 60 times and come back and forth from the disc sander and try it again and try it again and try it again and scribe it and leave enough wood so that you don't over subscribe, over scribe it, make it small.

So making all the risers of the little cleats that hold the seat in place. So I got a lot of the, a lot of the thinking is done. Now it's just doing the artwork. Making the wood. So I made all my templates, so today I'm going to focus a little bit on that. So that was the blockage. You know, every time something comes to a halt in your environment, you look around and you see all your projects.

Like Bob, you know, we talked about this, the, uh, the Volkswagen, you know, the Karmann Ghia. When you, like, when you have something that's just halting and you know, you know, you got to get to work on it and you keep blaming it on no time, but there's really something deeper and it's this confrontation that you're avoiding of doing the parts you're not sure of.

And I, and I was very severely. Deepen that with the boat. And so the other day I was like, I have no more excuses. Let me just do this one part and not think about anything past that. And then, okay, I got past that. Let me do this one part and not think about anything past that. And so just by isolating the little tasks, I was able to really kind of get past the blockage.

So that's good. I'm in the homestretch now. I really feel like I've gotten past that blockade. So, uh, for that, I feel like, I'm like, oh, this is in the bag. But prior to that, I'm like, whew, it's going to be one year in May that I haven't finished this boat. But now, I definitely see the light at the end of the tunnel in the middle of April.

So, feeling good about that. Yeah, that's 

[00:17:29] Bob: great. It must be nice to finish a big project like that. Oh god, it is. And not have it just sitting out in the barn somewhere, staring at you at a distance. Hmm. I feel bad. 

[00:17:39] Jimmy: Well, you're speaking from experience. No, I 

[00:17:41] Bob: don't know, I'm just, you know, I'm just throwing that out there.

Yes, I am. I absolutely am. Uh, let's see. For me, so we launched our, kind of pre launched our Arduino course yesterday, and, um, we're doing, it's actually launching tomorrow when the video goes, uh, on YouTube, but we're doing like a, like a 25 percent off discount code thing until Friday, so anybody listening to this, if it's a course that you're interested in taking, then there'll be a link in the description, you can still get the 25 percent off, you know, for, um, Basically all of Friday.

Uh, but like, we've been working really hard on this course and it It's interesting how long it takes to do something like this because I spend a huge amount of time writing and outlining and building, like, chapters and trying to break up all of this. Because we cover, like, basic electronics and the wiring, prototyping, physical part of it, as well as coding with assuming that nobody has any experience with any of it.

So we really had to start at the very beginning. Um, but trying to figure out how to... Lay all of that stuff out in a path that makes sense to somebody without any experience was that part was the big for me Was the longest kind of unknown thing to figure out, you know, and then Even once I finished shooting my part of it, then 4B has just been like heads down editing for a couple of months, like just doing that and building graphics and there's just so much that goes into getting one of these courses done, but it's done, it's out, I'm really proud of it, people are already buying it, and um, it's exciting to put something like this out that I know people are...

You know, not everybody needs, but some people really need it, and it'll be helpful. So, pretty excited about that. But to launch it, we were trying to come up with a project that was kind of Arduino based that we could make a YouTube video about that was a way to show off the course and what you can learn, but also just needs to like really catch people's eyes.

And, so, so I had this idea. A long time ago, I found a methane sensor. And I was like, oh, you can use a methane sensor with an Arduino. That's interesting. What causes methane? And so, yeah, exactly. So, for about like three years, I've had this, in my big idea list, I've had a line that just says, fart chair. And that was it.

And I never really thought any more about it until a few weeks ago. We were like, this is the thing. This is the video that will show people what you could do with an Arduino. Which may be the wrong call, now that I'm thinking about it. I don't know if this is like the right call. No, you made the right 

[00:20:32] David: decision.

[00:20:34] Bob: So, for the past week or so, I've been... Like I set up a quick like literally five minutes. Maybe not even maybe maybe three minutes prototype I got this thing working got some code on it that reads this sensor and You know like blinks a light shows a little concentration value on a little screen So I set it up in the house for the kids to test to gather data and They tested it a lot, and it totally works.

Turns out that the sensors aren't actually strong enough to... Like, there's not enough methane in a human fart to be measured by one of these sensors, but there's something in there that's being measured. I don't know what it is, but it's measuring something. So we just used that value. And then I ended up making, like, I took a chair with, like, a hollow bottom and...

Built in the sensor in the right spot and then mounted like a red light bulb and a buzzer down there and so when you sit on the chair and you fart the whole chair blinks and buzzes. I'm unsubscribing. Yeah, I figured. I'll probably unsubscribe with this one. It's hilarious though, it's so funny. And we set it up in the office, and I ended up also making a display, like a percentage display.

So, the chair is in one room in the office, and I kind of said, you know, we don't really prank people on this channel, so that's not what we're going to use this for. We set it up in one room, and then wired a display into another room above a door, so it has like a progress bar kind of LED display. So, anybody in the office, anytime they need to, can go into this room.

Fart in the chair, and then outside the room, you see this little meter go booooooop. 

[00:22:14] Jimmy: Oh god. 

[00:22:17] Bob: And so for the past several days, everybody's been competing for like the best score on this, uh, on this meter thing, and we went, we, the other day for lunch, it was like... Alright, it's mounted. Everybody's got a, you know, it's competition time.

So, we come back from lunch and, like, I got Taco Bell, Megan's got Taco Bell, Anthony had White Castle, Josh got some Indian food. So, everybody's, like, loading up. Um, and so, our office has been really interesting for the last few days. But, that's, you know, the project, I think, was really funny. And, I haven't seen the video yet.

It'll be done today. Um, 

[00:22:55] Jimmy: well, hopefully it won't... When does that 

[00:22:57] Bob: publish? I gotta read the comments. Yeah, no, I'm not gonna read the comments. Um, it's, it's one of those things that, like, is totally innocent and funny, and I tried not to be overly, you know, like, gross or anything. We tried to, like, joke around with it.

We have a lot of families and a lot of kids that watch our videos, and it'll either be in that sweet spot of the parents and kids will both think it's funny and that'll be fine, or it will be just a little bit too much for a parent that doesn't want their kid to, you know, I don't know, so it might backfire a little bit, but...

Have you um... One of my internet friends about it, and he was like, I don't know all of your other ideas, but this is the best idea you've ever had.

Anyway, what were you saying? 

[00:23:45] David: Have you done any chat GPT for writing 

[00:23:49] Bob: Arduino code? No, no, I haven't. I've seen that you can. Tell it to write code for you, but yeah, 

[00:23:57] David: I was just curious in the video released by Unnecessary Inventions yesterday He made basically made this thing attaches to your phone and it anytime your phone is awake It uses a little light sensor.

It keeps track of how much you use your phone and so He had Chet GPT write all the code for it. It wrote, so he was like, you know, there's a timer hooked up to it and he said, do this, and then it would write the code. He's like, okay, I need a little bit more functionality, we just say add this, and it kept adding to it.

And, according to him in his video, he didn't write anything by hand. The whole thing was written by AI. I just found that, um... For somebody like me, who, I don't want to spend the time to learn how to write that. That seems interesting. 

[00:24:48] Bob: Hmm. I've heard of other people doing that for JavaScript applications and stuff.

Um, and I think, I think if at the beginning you have a really... Granted, I have not tried this, so I have no experience with this at all. If you have a complete idea... I could see how that would get you to the thing that you want. But I think one of the things about writing code, about programming, is that you have a general idea, even a partially specific idea, that becomes more specific as you write it.

And so I think eventually there would be a point where... You would get something, output from it, and be like, well yeah, I mean this is like close, but I need to tweak, I need, I need to do this little thing. And I think there probably will be a point where a system like that just couldn't understand the nuance of what I wanted to do.

You know what I mean? But, I guess as a starting point. Now the flip side of that is if you, if you, it's like copying somebody else's code. You know, you have a starting point that you didn't write. Editing that starting point to be specifically what you need is going to be really difficult. So, without any experience.

If you've got experience, then maybe that's like a perfect way to kickstart it. I don't know. Yeah, I've never done that. Um, I've gotten some interesting emails lately about, uh, you know, just responses to things. And there have been a couple times at the end. That just say, please don't start using AI in your videos.

I mean, I can see that, you know. 

[00:26:23] David: It really angers some people, because I've done two AI designed project videos. The one did really well, and the other one did really bad. Um, all about titles and thumbnails, but, um, and there were some just interesting responses. There was, uh, more than a few people said, you know, this is not cool.

I'm out of here. I'm unsubscribing. I'm like, cool. See you later. Um, but I, I, yeah, I'm like, it was obvious that we're just. experimenting and trying to understand this you know instead of just ignoring it and I I understand the concerns I also understand the benefits of it so mm hmm 

[00:27:11] Bob: it's I think it's one of those it's it's like any other new technology where there's this there's this big unknown and people are gonna explore it as deeply as they can to understand where it fits not to make it fit everywhere To understand, like, where it's going to end up being the most useful and, you know, that's...

You could say the same thing about power tools. You could say the same thing about... I mean, look at epoxy, right? When epoxy got really popular, everybody used it in everything, whether it needed it or not, and then it backed off a little bit to... Okay, now we see the places where it actually makes sense, where it adds value, where it makes something look nicer, whatever, you know.

I mean, any new thing is going to get a... Explosion and then it's going to settle, but it'll be interesting to see how it how that stuff ends up being used both in Design and art, but also just in in I don't know in like propagation of interesting things The 

[00:28:08] Jimmy: problem is is people are never going to know when it is or isn't used in in in storytelling Yeah, 

[00:28:17] David: I think that's that's concerned you're removing the human element 

[00:28:21] Jimmy: Yeah, the other day a friend was over and he has the app on his phone and he said to me, he said, I might have told you guys this, he says, uh, tell me, uh, write a, write a story about Yamada Rasta.

And he showed me the phone and he was reading it and like kind of looking at it at a 45 degree angle and reading it and as he was reading it, it was writing the story. And it was 90 percent accurate, 95 percent accurate. And it was pretty amazing. And I remember this time last year when there was articles about us because the Netflix show was published.

A lot of the articles were just amalgamations of what was on the internet pieced through some AI. And it was the first time I was really reading this stuff about, about, about me and knowing that, oh, this is bits and chopped up pieces of, Conversations because the cadence is a little off and it sounds like somebody not English speaking wrote it.

It's because it was from the computer I guess, but now it's getting so good, it will get so good, and it just takes a human to just give it a quick edit to go back and make sure it sounds like there's not broken sentences and so on. 

[00:29:33] David: and it, and everybody's been using it, whether they know it or not. I mean, if you take a picture with your smartphone that's been made within the past five years, there's ai A, your phone is trying to determine what you're taking a photo of a plant or a person, and then it's enhancing that photo based on the subject.

Mm-Hmm. . Whether you've got a Google phone or an iPhone, it's using AI to enhance your 

[00:29:56] Bob: photos. Yeah. So this is interesting. So the, this is not what we planned, but we were going to talk about, you had the idea of talking about remixes and the AI thing works into that. It is that. I mean, these, these AI bots are not like sentient.

They are trained by previous creation, right? They are trained by photos that we've taken or texts that we've written or articles like you're saying. So really their responses are Some sort of an illogical reconfiguration of stuff that's already available. Whether it's specific text or it's an idea of how to say a thing.

You know, it's, it was trained on that stuff. Um, I mean you were wanting to talk about the kind of is anything new remix idea, right David? Yeah, 

[00:30:49] David: yeah, what I wrote down was are there any new ideas or is everything just a remix? And, and then, uh, as we're, as I said that to you before we hit record, and then I was thinking, has there ever been new ideas?

Or has everything always been a remix? 

[00:31:07] Bob: I think eventually there, originally there was at least one idea somewhere, you know? I mean, there had to be something. I suppose. I 

[00:31:14] David: suppose. 

[00:31:15] Jimmy: Well, could you imagine, so if you, you could research this, there was some time around the 1700s or the late 1800s or the early 1800s, the patent office was like tightening their budgets and somebody suggested, let's just turn the patent office off because there's going to be no more inventions.

We basically have all the perfect pharma equipment we're ever going to need. We have all the processes, we have all the medications we're ever going to need. We don't need the patent office anymore. So that was 200 years ago or 150 years ago. Now, could you imagine, let's get that guy wherever he is in his knickers and bring him forward and say, look, do you know what this is?

And then he would basically think he was another planet. The idea of an iPhone or just grab yourself from 20 years ago and bring yourself here and be like, oh yeah. That's awesome. You know, look at this thing, you're like, whoa, what is going on here? So are there new ideas? I believe that there are still brand new ideas that could come forth.

Occasionally you see that one invention, even if it's a practical stupid thing at the hardware store and you're like... Wow, this is, this is cool. I don't need it, but this is cool. This is useless, but wow, this is cool. You do that a few times a week if you go to Home Depot. Are you 

[00:32:30] David: talking about a probe lens?

[00:32:32] Jimmy: Probe lens. Yeah. Yeah, this is great. I don't need it, but this is great. Just any kind of like new helpy tool, you know, I've seen on TV. But as far as technology goes, there's always that one app that you like. Oh, ah, it doesn't happen often anymore because everything is, you just gotta really, really, really, really get past all the low hanging fruit, but I believe there are still new ideas.

[00:33:00] Bob: Well I think one thing that's interesting about this conversation, I think, I feel like we've talked about this before. We may have, yeah. Because there are groups of videos that are about the, you know, how certain things are remixes of other things and those remixes of other things. But, you're talking about like, are there new ideas?

This is like a meta view of that, but you kind of have to. Clarify what the idea is. Like, which part are we talking about here, if we're talking about something new? Is it a new, like you're saying, is it a new use for a certain thing? Or is it a new way to do something else? Those are different, right? A new use for a screwdriver means you could use it as a hammer.

A new way to turn a screw means you come up with something other than a screwdriver to do the 

[00:33:43] Jimmy: thing. Right. Well, like, like, like Andy's conceal, like, uh, Pika, Pika Screw. You know, the, the head conceals. That's an altogether new idea. Yeah, 

[00:33:53] Bob: yeah. So, like, it's easy to say that there's no new ideas in that, um, there's no new things to be done, but there's new ways to do the things that we already do, you know?

[00:34:04] David: Is that a new idea, or is that just a new way to make a hidden screw? There's been hidden screws 

[00:34:10] Bob: before. Well, that's what I'm asking, though. Like, which part is the idea? Is it, is it the new, the new creation or is it a new usage or is it a new, uh, way to execute? Like those are individual things and so it's easy to remix, lump everything togethers well.

It's easy to, to lump it all together and be like, yeah, everything is a remix of something done. 

[00:34:31] Jimmy: Well, here's, here's an interesting thing. If we're gonna break apart Andy's idea, um, it's peek a screw. If you haven't seen it, it's a screw that has a, a, it's, it's. Apparent right there once you've shown it, but you can't see it until you've shown it.

It's the, the surface dimples in and creates a lock so you could unscrew something. But what I found interesting about Andy's thing is that the technology behind being able to cut a piece that fits so. Superbly inside of another piece of you can't see the mating line. So the technology got to a point.

That's not something you probably could have done 25 years ago. Or at least with the ease you can do it now. You can do a wire EDM cut out. Of the positive and then the negative. And then you have. Two pieces that mate so seamlessly that the line disappears and that's the beauty of his invention is that the line is not apparent.

And then once it's apparent, it's almost like a magic trick. It's almost like, it's, it's like the floor is lava and all of a sudden the floor turns into lava and you're like, whoa, what's going on here? But in reality, that's the little experience you have. So the invention really is like, is the experience you have when you're tightening or unscrewing the thing.

It's just a screw, but the cool part of it is when you...

And I feel that, again, that, that invention is, it's a use of a couple of things brought together to make something new because nobody would try and hide something in plain sight and see if they can get away with it as easily as, like, like that. I mean, I guess magicians do it all the time, but it makes sense.

No. No. It doesn't make sense. Yeah, it does. I'm not sure if it makes sense to me. 

[00:36:15] Bob: Well, it does. I mean, it's like the. I guess that's kind of what I'm saying there, is that the, the thing, it's a screw. That's not the invention. It's how you access the thing. And so is that idea of access, is that new enough? Or is that, you know, to be seen as a new thing or as a remix of something else?

And then, but I think another big part of this is, you know, we're looking at When we think about reuse of ideas or, you know, modifying an idea, we're looking at our own, um, uh, historical collection of, of, like, documentation, right? All of the things that each of us have ever seen, ever experienced, ever, watched, happened, ever used.

Those are the things that are informing what we can remix. And so if I am on an island, and I've never seen anything ever, but I come up with an idea, that's a new idea. Whether somebody else has done it or not, it's a new idea because it's not based in me, it's not based on somebody else. I would pause it.

And so I think that one of the reasons everything feels like a remix now, from that perspective, is because everything is so documented. A hundred years ago, things were still documented, but not anywhere close to the way they are now. A hundred years before that, you could have entire Like groups of people coming up with weaponry that were exactly the same independently out of necessity, you know what I mean?

And I think the further you go back, the less documentation there is of people creating things, coming up with ideas, uh, building civilizations and, you know, governmental systems and stuff independently, even if they were exactly the same. And so it becomes super easy for us to just be like, well, yeah, everything's like the thing that I saw when I was a kid or when I was a teenager or whatever, because I saw it.

That's not always been the case. So, I don't know if it's any different or if it's just we can see it. 

[00:38:14] Jimmy: So what happens now is we're all human AI bots. We're, we're, we're not, we're in, we're reality intelligent. What's the opposite of artificial 

[00:38:24] Bob: intelligence? We're, yeah, we're being trained on the things that we've seen and that's what we use to create.

And we 

[00:38:28] Jimmy: all, and we all regurgitate. It's all a 

[00:38:31] Bob: simulation, man! I 

[00:38:33] Jimmy: didn't want to regurgitate a big... Well, I did it, I had a TEDx talk, it's out there, you can find it. I did it at a high school about ten years ago. And I talked about the more input in your brain, and I called it the slurry that just like, is on, like all, it's like, it's like the garbage juice that drips out of a garbage truck in the city.

That's at the bottom of, that's like what your brain sits in and all that juice is all the different things that you take in. And then your brain like sucks up out of the juice and then brings to your forefront the idea of a new egg basket's, a combination, you know, it's like an egg basket with a, you know, someone's face on it.

You, for no reason because the AI is coming up, you know, the, the, the reality I, what would you call it? Just the intelligence. You leave away the word, you leave word the leave out the artificial word. , yeah. I-R-L-I-R-L. The IRL Intelligence. 

[00:39:28] David: IR , IRLI to speak to 

[00:39:31] Jimmy: ours. I-R-I-L-I has, uh, has, uh, you know, the wherewithal to, to put Kermit's face on the.

The Egg Basket. Just because he's having fun. He, meaning me, is having fun. But then, you know, that's kind of stupid. So let me put out 13 and your brain goes through hundreds of things until you come up with one that's like practical, suits the needs, has a little bit of a new invention. You know, I always say, I always say, if your brain could put out the G code in a day, it would be millions of lines long.

Millions of lines long of the thought process that goes into You know, what is the cut path for me to make this boat, for instance, what is the cut path for me to, use cut path and G code interchangeably, what is the G code? For me to make coffee this morning, what is the g code for me to turn on the computer today?

Like all those things, and then all the, all the, like, oh, let me turn on the, oh, let me move this out of the way, let me plug that in, let me turn on my, my, my light. You know, all these things go into the IRL intelligence when it, when I'm thinking about trying to invent something. 

[00:40:41] David: I don't think my G Code is very efficient.

So let's say I want to go turn on the computer, my hand gets distracted by the coffee mug that's right by the computer, so then I'm going to drink some coffee first, then turn on the computer. I'm saying, 

[00:40:53] Jimmy: I'm saying that's all part of the G Code. All that goes together to ultimately spit out an egg basket.

I just keep using that because that's my week's project that spits out a wireframe egg basket. All that goes into it, you know, touching the coffee, grabbing the, because the whole time it's, it's in the background, so I'm going to make a giant, I'm going to make a giant super soaker, you know, because Bob, that's what you made.

And the whole, that week you're making that super soaker, everything you're doing is going into that. What is it going to be that super soaker? How is it going to be made? Is it going to be plywood? Is it going to be plastic? What do I get? What do I get a tube with round ends? Where do I get the hose? Is it going to work?

You know, where am I going to stay when I'm with Mark? You know, like all these things go into that AI or that IRL eye. So when you get there, it all goes into the invention. Now that makes sense. 

[00:41:41] David: Do you guys, when you're making something physical, For yourself and you're inspired by another designer, do you ever try to make something exactly the way you saw it to learn the process or are you always trying to put your own spin on it to make it unique 

[00:42:01] Jimmy: in your own way?

I personally always put my own spin on it and I'll give you an example at Workbench Con I met a dude and he came to me and said, look, I'm going to make plans. He's probably listening. So thank you. He says, I'm going to make plans. Uh, I'll make plans of your work and, you know, and I'll take, I'll handle it all and you know, we'll do a profit share and I like that idea because then I don't really have to be that involved and he was asking me, what do you think about how accurate should we be?

We had a little meeting and I said, I go, honestly, as long as it looks like the image on camera, you can make up your own dimensions, it doesn't matter because my goal is to get people to subscribe. Take that and do their own version of it. If they want to make it exactly, they could follow the plans and get exactly what the thing is, but I'm really encouraging them to, to color outside the lines.

So, I mean, I personally like to color outside the lines, but I 

[00:42:54] David: think I'm the same way. 

[00:42:56] Bob: Yeah, I don't ever remember trying to replicate something exactly, except for a prop, but there's a little different motivation there. Um, I think I've, I just naturally want to make something that has my own spin on it. I think just so I don't feel like I'm copying.

It feels like it's an evolution rather than a copy. But I guess this goes back to like the whole You know, you were asking earlier, like, is it okay to copy stuff? Like, so all of this Remix talk and all of the taking what you've, the stuff you've been trained on and making another, the next iteration or amalgamation of things.

Is that bad? It's like being inspired by a style or a specific item and then making the next step. Is that a bad thing? I don't 

[00:43:46] Jimmy: think so. I mean, I say it all the time. That's the only way to get good at it is to just keep making it over and over and over again. And, uh, by the way, I was talking about Brett, Brett Cope, and he's going to take my plans and we're going to start with five projects and turn them into a little website and see where it goes from there.

But, um... The, the idea of iteration, I think is, is really one of the most important things as a designer, as an artist. To make one thing and say, I'm done, and then go to the next thing and say, I'm done, to go to the next thing and say, I'm done. I don't think you could really mature as a designer if you just keep doing one thing and moving on.

I think you really have to iterate on each one of those things. It makes you more of a mature problem solver, somebody that's more willing to be able to handle anything that comes at them. That's it. I think that's the goal is to be able to look at anything and go, yeah, we could, we could design our way out of this situation.

[00:44:43] David: We could design our way out of this. That's, I never think about that, but you, I'm constantly in that position. Yeah. 

[00:44:51] Jimmy: Yeah. And oh, I just want to, just one thing on my other point where day to day, like when we're, we're iterating in our mind or we're doing IRL intelligence on, for instance, again, the example at hand is the wire basket.

And in my own globe, if you could imagine a globe around my head, and, um, Making coffee, thinking about the wire basket. Grabbing the, my backpack, thinking about the wire basket, doing this. And then when somebody pops that bubble and goes, Hey, did you watch, uh, Yellowstone this weekend? And I'm like, what? I was busy thinking about my basket, drinking coffee, eating lunch, and doing my own thing.

What? Uh, did you watch Yellowstone? I'm like, I don't care about the Yellowstone. And then all of a sudden, like, my bubbles burst, so there's like a G code, it's like someone's pouring, like, water on my keyboard, you know?

So for me, that's why I like to be, like... In silence all the time. Not silence, but you know, I like to be like, left alone. You know, like I would always joke when I would hire a new assistant, I'd be like, do you talk a lot? Because you can't. Because you're not allowed to. You're only allowed to talk to me about things that are important.

You know, in reference to the project at hand or whatever. But, you know, when someone's just chit chatty, for the sake of being chit chatty, It, it screws up my, my G code. It's like, don't mess with my G code. I'm writing g code in real time and you're messing with every aspect of it by asking me something that has nothing to do with what's going on in this room.

[00:46:20] David: Yeah. Yeah. 

[00:46:23] Bob: So. I think back to, 

[00:46:25] David: uh, when I first picked up the guitar and I think the first song, maybe the first song that I learned was Smoke on the Water. And that's probably a lot of people's first song. And at that time Nirvana was really huge. So. I learned a lot of Nirvana songs and then my songs sounded very similar, just much crappier.

And I, I think even though I was trying to copy a certain style, the way, because of my experience, my skill, the equipment that I had, it still sounded like me. So it still, it was Nirvana ish, but it was, it was crappy. And I. It's really, really hard to copy somebody exactly. You have to really try, I think, to copy somebody exactly, without putting your own spin 

[00:47:18] Jimmy: on it.

No, it's funny. In the beginning, when my style was catching on, a lot of people would say, oh, I love what you do. And then they'd write me back a week later, and they'd be like, or a month later, they'd be like, well, I made my first video, and it looks exactly like yours, so I hope you don't mind. And I never did.

I thought it was a flatter, I was flattered by it. But then when I would watch it, I'd be like, wow, this, I mean, that's obviously inspired by me, but there's certain aspects that I would never do, but I like what they've done. And it's just the same thing. So I think it's important as any artist to start out doing they admire and then slowly turn it into their own.

I mean, it will only become your own. This quote of mine that's been bouncing around, I said it last year at Makers Central is just like everybody has an individual voice and individual facial feature. What you do with your hands and your mind is also going to be individual to you. No matter what. But from like a thousand mile view, everybody has a head and a face and a set of eyes, so we all look the same.

But as you get closer and closer and closer, everybody's an individual. Everyone's voice, you know, we all have, uh, you know, the English accent, but when you really zero in closer and closer, our English accents are very different. Mine's regional, even where I live. And so are all of ours. And so is our thinking, our way with our hands, the way we hold tools, the way chisels, the way we keep our tools.

You know, you see guys that have super sharp chisels and their woodwork reflects that. You have guys that have non sharp tools and their woodwork reflects that. And both might work for, for, yeah, right. Like me, like I buy a, I buy a perfectly sharp set of chisels. I put them in my drawer and something happens that like the unsharpening gnomes come and that night they like.

Take emery board and rub the ends of all my chisels. Like those chisels cost me hundreds of dollars because they're brand new, sharp, and I can't cut end grain with them. Why? You know, they did the day I opened them, I put them in the drawer, and then the unsharpening gnomes come. 

[00:49:12] Bob: I think David, you know, bringing up the music is a really good example.

Of why it's, why it's necessary, because I mean, you're totally right. It is very difficult musically to copy someone exactly because the music that you hear is made up of so many different things. It's not one thing. It's, it's instrumentation. It's actual skill. It's 

[00:49:33] Jimmy: a voice. It's timing. Yeah. 

[00:49:35] Bob: And, and so like, Trying to recreate something exactly is practically impossible, really.

I mean, you got to work really, really hard. But, you know, you can also look at the kind of, uh, historical music family tree and see the music that we have today. You can trace it very specifically by song, by album, back to where it came from and where that came from and where that came from. And you can follow it all the way back to see that.

Everything that we listen to is, uh, you know, it's derived from something before. It's based on, but not exactly like the thing before it. Um, and, you know, if we didn't have that, as a society, didn't have that kind of remix mentality, we would still be, like, beating on animal skins. And, and just doing the same basic rhythm that we did at the very, very beginning.

Um, but you can see like how varied the, you know, musical stuff is now, just because somebody grabs this one part and they tweak it a little bit, which creates a new branch of the tree, you know, and that's how you get R&amp; B and that's how you get... Jazz and blues and rock and, you know, you get all these things and then rock splits into hard rock and soft rock and alternative rock and, you know, whatever.

And, I mean, that's a necessary part of, of us, like, not being the same. And I would say the same is probably true for design, visual design. I couldn't follow that path backward as easily as I can. Music, but, so, I mean, I would say that the, the whole, like, being inspired by being, learning from the previous thing and then adding your own spin, remixing, I think it's, I think it's part of what makes us, uh, a really diverse kind of creative community, I would say.

Yeah. 

[00:51:22] David: There was a, um, there was a video that I watched, it was probably a couple years ago by now, but it was Nirvana's Come As You Are, and is it, is it a rip off of, uh, a band called Killing Joke? And it's very similar, but then the maker of the video goes, well, is the Killing Joke song a rip off of this other song?

And it goes back, and it just keeps going back generations, and... Where is the originality in there? It does all kind of sound like a, like 

[00:51:53] Bob: a, like a remix. I heard an interview with Dave Grohl one time. This blew my mind. So, I was huge, am huge Nirvana fan as well. And this interview was him and, uh, somebody else.

And they were asking him where the drum fill came at the beginning of Smells Like Teen Spirit. And he was like, oh, I stole that from this disco band. I think it was like... Casey and the Sunshine Band or something like that. And they played the clip at the beginning of this disco song and it was totally the check on kuh keck on kuh keck on, you know that?

And he was like, and he was admitting it was a straight rip, like I listened to disco and then I ripped it off and I put it at the beginning of a song and I'm like, whoa! I wouldn't have known that. 

[00:52:32] David: That same interview, he talks about ripping off other disco fills in there, and he gives examples, so it's not just that blickum, blickum, blickum, there's some other ones in there too.

Um, yeah, that kind of blew my mind as well. 

[00:52:46] Bob: But that, I mean, that's proof that it's, it's not a bad thing, like, I didn't have the learned, you know, historical thing to go, oh, I've heard that before, I know that he took that. It didn't matter. Like, in the context of what I was listening to, it was new. So, yeah.

And another thing I was thinking about while we were talking is that... You can't look at, like, if you look at the AI stuff, you cannot look at the AI thing that is happening right now as an individual moment in time. It is the next step on top of the thing that happened before and happened before. It could not have happened if people were not doing the work that they did five years ago.

Based on the people that were doing work five years before that. Based on computing starting in the 70s, you know, personal computing. Based on big, giant room computers before that, you know what I mean? It's like, none of this stuff is truly stand 

[00:53:41] Jimmy: alone. To think about photography, and I'm old enough to know that if I mention this, there are going to be people that will be like, Really?

I didn't realize that. Talk about photography. When I learned how to use a camera in the 80s, a regular standard camera where you had to adjust your shutter speed, you had to adjust the ISO of the film you choose, whichever film, whether it's Ektachrome or Daylight or, or whatever, Ektachrome or Kodachrome or whatever temperature, whether it's black and white, 400 speed, Ilford, all these different types of film, You had to choose what you wanted.

And then when you go out, you got to read the light meter and know that if you go a little over the light media this way, a little under that way, if you want some motion blur, all that type of stuff. Now the camera on your phone made all those decisions for you. So Dave, when you were saying how the camera has AI, that's a very good example.

When you think back and you were given a camera, you had to put the film in it and then you had to decide, okay, um, what is my light sensitivity? I, I have, I remember buying. A, when I would shoot film, motion picture film in my Aeroflex camera, which I did for one summer before digital became the thing, I had my, uh, my light meter.

And I remember how important it was to have a light meter and like check like right under the subject's chin, like the meter. I occasionally that like churns up in my stuff and I look at it and I'm like, I remember buying how important this was and now you don't need it at all. I mean, some photographers still pull it out, you know, cause there's just so old school, but you don't need it at all.

The camera does all the thinking for you. It's digital, you take one picture and you're like, Oh, let me lighten it up. And then you just change the dials a little bit. Where in the old days, you didn't know what you got until you came back from the lab. So you'd shoot all day long. Bracket to make sure that you got at least a good one out of three versions of the shot.

You go above, below, and in between. But now you just shoot one picture and get a reference. At that time, 

[00:55:32] David: you had to make all your decisions at the point of clicking the shutter. Now you make the decisions on the computer because the cameras have more dynamic range. So if your lighting isn't perfect, you can fix it in post.

[00:55:45] Bob: And 

[00:55:46] David: whether that's good or bad, that's just how things are. And you have more options now. You can make creative decisions later instead of 

[00:55:54] Bob: earlier. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I guess in any case like that, you still got the kind of, you can, you can Make decisions before and or after, like editing in the camera, you know, you can only shoot the parts that you think you're going to want to edit, or you can shoot everything and then have to deal with it later.

Same idea, I guess. So I would say, in my response to this whole, like, the AI thing, the remix, the taking other people's designs and iterating, whatever, I think it's a natural part of what we do as creative people. I think it would be. Really bad for us if we didn't, if we tried to completely avoid that, because it's not, it doesn't make any sense not to.

I think one thing that gets missed a lot is respect for the thing that you're inspired by, that you're building on, that you're whatever, is I think a lot of times people want to prove that they have a new idea at the expense of you know, giving recognition to what led them there. Mm hmm. That make sense?

I mean, I think a lot of times we can be very easy It can be very easy to just be like, I saw this thing on Instagram a while back, I took a picture of it, I don't know where it came from, whatever, it doesn't matter because it led me to this thing and now I'm going to act like I have this brand new idea.

I think it's far more beneficial to other people to see that... Share the path. Yeah, to see that like, you don't have to start from zero, nobody, we've just given a hundred examples of nobody starts from zero. Everybody starts with learned stuff. And if you can like, honor the thing that... Inspired you, give them some credit, and also let other people know that it's okay to be iterative, I think that's a good 

[00:57:34] David: thing.

It's not always easy to do that, because we have so much of that garbage juice in our brains, sometimes we don't know where the source comes from. And we might think we have a totally original idea, but... Yeah. I saw that on Instagram five years ago. Yeah, yeah, 

[00:57:51] Bob: yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course. I mean, you know what?

I do know there's, there's stuff that we saw when we, when we were children that we have no idea what it was, where it was, how it got into our brain. It's still there. Obviously we can't do that about everything, but you know, I think in the design world, in the music world, maybe, maybe that's harder to do too.

But I think just giving recognition publicly or somehow to the thing that led you to where you are, I think is beneficial more than it is. Like, you know, making you look like you're just copying. In my opinion. But, Jimmy, you were going to say something. Uh, 

[00:58:24] Jimmy: I was going to say, I always, if I think I have a new invention, I always put, for instance, the barbecue pit that I made, where you crank the lever and it goes up and down by scissors on both sides of the grill.

I put that out there thinking, okay, somebody must have done this somewhere in the world. And I'll find out. In about 10 minutes when I publish this video, because right away people be like, Oh, Bill Smith made that in Argentina at 75. I still haven't gotten that. No one's told me that. No one's told me that it's been out there.

Everyone sends me the video of the, the, the grill. When you pull the lever, it flips. Which is also a really cool invention. You pull a lever and the grill like literally does a 180 flip. But you have to sandwich all your food in there so it doesn't fly off. It's like two grills that sandwich cooking meat and then you pull the lever and it flips over and flips back.

And that also, when I saw that flip grill before I made my raising and lowing grill, I saw that and I was like, oh, should I make one of those? And I was about to make that. It would have been me making somebody else's thing, but trying to put my own spin on it. And then because of My research seeing that and several other things, I came to the conclusion of the scissor lift.

It also, because I have a scissor lift to change the light bulbs in my shop. So all that slurry at that time led me to make a barbecue grill that just goes up and down. And from what I can tell, I mean, it's not patented. Anybody can steal it and go manufacture it. From what I can tell, I think I made the first one that does exactly that.

But I had no idea. I wasn't 100 percent sure. And I knew the comment section would set me straight. So I put it out there. It's like, hey, I just made this. I don't know if it's an invention or not, but I made it. I didn't claim that it was some brand new thing. I didn't patent it. I got involved with a company that wanted to manufacture it.

And they rushed to patent it because it had been published for still under one year at the time. And ultimately it never... Then COVID came and nobody wanted to make anything ever again. We didn't manufacture the barbecue pit. 

[01:00:23] David: Not dramatic at all. 

[01:00:26] Bob: Any other thoughts on this topic? One 

[01:00:29] David: more thing before Brian sends me a message.

I am very familiar and I love the quotes by Mitch Hedberg. I remixed the remix and was back to normal.

I remixed the remix and it was back to normal. That's funny. 

[01:00:50] Bob: Cool. Well, I'm going to thank our Patreon supporters who are awesome. Uh, and they all get the after show, which we're going to record after this. And I don't know if we have anything interesting to talk about or not. I have some sad news. Oh no.

Okay. Well, uh, big thanks to everybody that helps us out over there. It means a lot and we are very grateful for you. There's a top group that always goes above and beyond that supports us and we're really grateful. Um, uh, that's Crabtree Creative. The We Ranch Woodworks, Gretchen Hofer, Michael Edin, Warren Works, stew Morrison, Scott Warren, Oden Leather Goods Rich at Lowen Designs.

Grant, a dad crafted Chad Custom Creations Chad from Man Crafting Works by Solo Alberts Woodworks and Corey Ward. Uh, there's also people like Jacques Spa. I don't know if I said your last name right, Jacques, but I like your name. I think it's cool. Uh, there's people at all different levels that, that support the show, and they all get the after show, regardless of the level of support.

So, thank you, to all of you. If you want to join that crew, go to patreon. com slash making it. And help us out. We would appreciate it. That would be awesome. Jimmy, uh, David ran away. I don't know where he went. So, do you have something to recommend? Yeah, you know, I 

[01:02:05] Jimmy: was just going through my stuff the other day.

We've been at this now for 10 years, at least, all of us. There are certain people that aren't quite in the forefront, they're just not quite as vocal, but they definitely need to be honored and remembered, and that would be Frank Hallworth. I got a chance to see Frank Hallworth at WorkbenchCon, and he looks like somehow he got 10 years younger.

I don't know what he did to himself. I was like, what are you doing? I go, you look like, I guess he got slimmer. He just looks amazing, and so I compliment him, and he's just giggling. You know, Frank doesn't talk much, he giggles a lot, and that's how he communicates. He's just a, he's just an incredibly talented guy and he's still out there and he's still doing stuff.

So don't forget about Frank Haworth. Go check out Frank. If you don't know him, he's a woodturner and just an incredible inventor. Very playful in his day to day. And he, I've never seen anybody use a CNC machine as in depth and as inventive. As he has. 

[01:03:03] Bob: Really fantastic. David, what'd you get? 

[01:03:09] David: I have, um, well, I'm going to go to this week, just because Jimmy brought it up, but somebody built a, uh, an EDM machine, and they have a Kickstarter for a desktop EDM machine.

Oh boy. Yeah, so basically he just made the power supply, which is very complicated. And then you can use an existing 3D printer or CNC to do the thing. So that is the first one. That wasn't going to be a recommendation since Jimmy brought that up. And then the other one is just this beautiful, satisfying video to watch is the process of making elevator buttons.

So that's a high, uh, it's a button factory in Japan that makes elevator buttons. And, it's just, there's no, there's no, yeah, there's no talking in it. Uh, there's captions, they have like closed captioning that kind of walk you through what they're, what they're doing, but it's just really cool to see elevator buttons being made.

[01:04:14] Bob: Interesting. Okay, well, uh, not really sure about that, I want to check that out just because I, Don't really know what to expect with that one. Um, I was looking through my history and I have not watched anything new. Did I talk about smart classical piano? Probably not. I don't know that I would have. So, I did mention a while back that I've been trying to learn this classical piece, Clair de Lune, which is a Difficult, and giving me a lot of trouble, and I've switched over trying to learn something else right now.

Um, but there's, I found this channel called Smart Classical Piano, and it's this guy, I don't know what his name is, probably should have known that, but he does, um, he's like a, like a performance piano player, like he's amazing, and so he does these Really deep dives on songs, and he'll do an entire song, or he'll do a little section of a song, and then he'll do live streams.

And so I've been watching the one, the live stream he did that's like an hour long about how to play Clair de Lune, and he breaks down each piece of it, talks about like the way to, what fingers to use to make it flow, but then he's also talking about the intention of the person writing the music. They wanted this part to be the thing that floats above the rest of it, and they wanted this part to, you know, the tempo to go in and out in this way, and it's just...

It's really interesting, as someone who plays piano, to get a different perspective. It's not just about hitting the notes on the right time. It's the expression of the whole thing. And so, I'm learning a lot from him, and if you're a piano player, you know, who wants to kind of get a different perspective on certain songs, whether you know them or not, it's pretty good stuff.

Um, so it's smart classical piano. And if you're not a piano player, then, I don't know. Maybe it's not useful at all to you. I've been watching them a bit lately. I have not been watching much of anything else, which is kinda weird, but we've been heads down in this, uh, this course stuff. 

[01:06:18] Jimmy: Can I, can I, uh, say a pet peeve?

Of course. Uh, how come elevator buttons don't have the number to the floor on the button? They're always next to the button. And I have a hard time figuring what floor to go to. I noticed that when I was in Atlanta, every time I went to go type the floor, I would push the button. I would push the number, not the button.

I literally, like, my finger would scan, like, floor 10, and I'd hit the button. I'd hit the actual number 10. 

[01:06:49] Bob: Well, I mean, it'd probably be so that they can manufacture the same button for every floor of every 

[01:06:54] Jimmy: elevator. Yeah, I mean, I know it seems like a practical thing, but it's so annoying. Because you get in an elevator from like the 1940s and it's got like a beautiful Art Deco number 10 and you go to push it and the 10 lights up.

But now it's like all these mechanical... buttons next to all these mechanical stick on floor numbers. And they're like just far enough away where you're like, Am I supposed to hit the button on the left side of the number? Or the button on the right side of the number? Oh. And your brain has to go all the way to the right side to see like which side of the row of buttons the numbers are on and then apply that to the next row, the next row, the next row if you're in a high floor number and then all of a sudden you're like landing on the wrong floor.

That's 

[01:07:33] David: it. I'm done. I just, I just texted you an image. There's um, I've, I've seen these images before of Elevator, Elevator Bunker Confusion. 

[01:07:42] Jimmy: That's exactly what I'm, that's exactly what I'm talking about. Well this is, this is old and new. This 

[01:07:47] Bob: is a combination of old and new. That's hilarious. Wow. Terrible.

[01:07:53] Jimmy: Alright, cool. But you can tell, they just go like, oh give us a... Give us a 13 floor panel, uh, 13 floor button setup, and then, uh, you know, a bucket of numbers and we'll, we'll stick them in the right spot. That's the new way. Hey, 

[01:08:03] David: you just punched that into the AI, and that's what the AI spits out. 

[01:08:06] Jimmy: Yeah, it gives you this thing that you just hit the facial.

There's no human element. 

[01:08:09] Bob: Yeah. Cool. We can complain more about that in the after show, which we're going to go do right now. Thanks for listening, everybody. Love 

[01:08:17] David: you. Thank you, thank you. 

[01:08:18] Jimmy: Love you.
