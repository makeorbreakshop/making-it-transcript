385-Making It
===

[00:00:00] Bob: We're back! After a week off. Was it nice to have a Wednesday off? 

[00:00:04] Jimmy: It was. You know what's so funny? I came right here and I stood here for about five minutes. It was exactly like 9. 01 and I said, oh we have a day off. But I got all prepped and ready. I got my coffee and everything and I came to the desk and I sat here.

It was all early. Today I was two minutes late. Well, that's awesome. To 

[00:00:24] Bob: make up for it.

Well, I was in a cabin, uh, last Wednesday. Didn't even think about you guys. No offense or anything. Aww. But, uh, didn't even think about you. Hardly offended at all. Good. We 

[00:00:39] Jimmy: went to... Oh, you finish, I'll 

[00:00:41] Bob: tell you something. I was gonna say, we went to this, uh, this cabin on a lake. It's like a couple hours from here, hour and a half, something like that.

And it was beautiful. It was out in the middle of nowhere. 

[00:00:52] Jimmy: How was the weather? Was it extremely cold? It was 

[00:00:54] Bob: rainy. It was rainy and cold. It was definitely like a, hey, I'm going to stay inside this nice cabin, kind of, you know. But, it was, it wasn't terrible. It was just chilly and wet. So, it wasn't, like, a lot to do outside.

But, I mean, this place was, I don't even know how tall it was, because it was on the side of a hill, looking out over a lake, so, you know, you walk in at, what is ground level, but then as you walk through the house, the ground sinks away and the house gets taller, so by the time you get to the back side of it, And you're on the first, the top floor deck, looking down over the water, you're like, 7500 feet off the water.

It was awesome. So the house is 

[00:01:33] Jimmy: plugged into like a big mountainside or hillside? Yeah, yeah. 

[00:01:36] Bob: Nice. Um, so we had these like two decks stacked on top of each other. It was like a giant room with a pool table. We made up a game, pool game, which was really fun. Um, and, yeah, it was a great weekend. But the, the place itself was super nice.

It was a really nice cabin we found on Airbnb. And it made me want a cabin. Uh oh. Yeah, I'm not going to get a cabin. You can build one. I might build one. You to build one. I might one of these days. Anyway, so we did that this weekend. Or last week, I guess. And it was fantastic. Anyway, what were you going to say, Jimmy?

[00:02:17] Jimmy: Oh, it's totally lost in the moment, but I was going to say that when I walk up to the mic and I realize we have The day off, I have a secret hour and a half that I don't have to tell anybody what I'm doing. Because everybody thinks I'm doing the podcast, so my people in my environment don't bother me.

And so I had one and a half hours to just go and play and do what I wanted. And then everyone starts, oh, is your podcast over? Is your podcast over? It's like 11, I start getting the calls. 

[00:02:45] Bob: What did you do with your hour and a half? I forgot. It was that good. It 

[00:02:50] David: was that good. 

[00:02:51] Jimmy: No, I probably went out to the shop and dilly dallied around with no phone calls or text messages coming in or out.

It's just a little secret hour and a half that I usually get when we don't have the day on. 

[00:03:02] David: Cool. I don't know if you have the luxury of doing so, but I have my phone on do not disturb from I think 1030 at night all the way to 6 p. m. The next day and the only calls that come through or only texts that come through are my brother and Kelly.

Everybody else, like if you try to call and you call multiple times, um, the phone will allow it to come to you thinking it might be an emergency, but I get I get, I just handle all my texts in the evening, after work. 

[00:03:35] Jimmy: If I don't answer right away, people, because they know me, my pattern is like, Are you okay?

I texted you like 8 seconds ago, are you okay? I get one of those. It's not so bad, as long as I knock them down as they come in, and it's most often, it's usually Howard, my partner, we Just chit text through the day. And if things get serious, that's when I know, when he picks up the phone and calls me, I'm like, uh oh, okay, there's a crisis or we just made a lot of money.

It's either one 

[00:03:59] Bob: or the other. Really good or really bad. 

[00:04:03] Jimmy: But that is also, you know, my family. We have an ongoing text. My dad, just to clarify, my dad's okay. I went and saw him and a lot of people on Instagram thought that maybe I was, I was making, uh... You know, more of a serious thing. My dad is, he's, he's taken ill a few times, he's 83 and when he gets sick he gets these slight bouts of dementia and so it's happened to him twice since Thanksgiving, he gets like a fever and he gets these, and so he was in the hospital for about six or seven days recently and when he got out I went to go see him the other day and I did a little Instagram story on him.

So my dad's just getting, he's just getting up there and we're starting to clean up his house, his house is, he's Pretty messy, pretty messy for a hoarder. And so, in fact, it's not messy. My dad is very neat, but he's got about He's got about 5, 000 pounds of stuff in a house that should hold about 500 pounds of stuff.

Put it through that way, but it's all neatly organized and it doesn't, he doesn't need it. So we're slowly going over there and taking stuff away and giving stuff away. There might even be a call to action soon if you live in Long Island. If anybody's looking for a rusty old drill that's been out in the rain, my dad's got about 40 of them.

If there's anybody on Long Island that wants a leaf blower that's probably been snowed on 40 times, he's got about 80 of them. So you can see, you can see where I'm headed. Yeah. Yeah. Gotcha. He has multiples of everything, so. But my dad's good. Good. He's just showing his age. Yeah. 

[00:05:32] Bob: So. It happens. Happens to all of us.

Well, what have you guys been into the last 

[00:05:40] Jimmy: couple of weeks? Since I got the mic, I'm working on my boat, my Carolina shoe boat, the one that I'm building from scratch. And then Patrick Reynolds and I took on this boat. His brother works with the company, Blue Point Brewery, and that's how we got the gig.

And Blue Point Brewery is on Long Island. And they have these... roving bar units that are an old boat, like an old fisher boat, fisherman's boat, on a fixed onto a trailer and they show up at an event and the awnings automatically go up with an electrical cam and then it becomes a mobile bar unit. The boat never comes off the trailer, they're fixed on the trailer, but 10 years old.

And it's been out in the weather so we volunteered for pay to take it on, take the project on and get to know the company and so this is our first project with them, might be the beginning of more doing sort of mobile advertising type things. So we took on this project and we ripped it apart yesterday and it's a lot of total boat Chemicals going to go into this one.

Patching holes and fixing construction. The boat came and it was peeling apart. The whole back boat, I should know the names of these parts of the boat. The bow, the stern. The whole stern part is ripped open and the boat is hanging. So, it's a lot of construction stuff. But the good thing is that it doesn't have to float.

It's all cosmetic and construction stuff. So we'll work on that. And then we've got to bring it up to a finish that's going to look pretty for presentation. So it's kind of like, it's like a bullet bourbon project for me. But with a different brand. And, uh, besides that, just everything's going good. We got a big snowstorm here a couple of days ago.

I could always tell when I wake up in the morning, it's like seven or six or seven in the morning and it's totally quiet. I remember opening up. Opening up my eyes and thinking, it's either, like, well, I was, became awake, but my eyes were closed, so I said, it's either five in the morning, or there's a foot of snow outside, I can't really tell, and then I kind of open my eyes and I see a little bit of light coming through the shades, and I'm like, it's gotta be snow, cause it's light enough out, and then I pull the shades up and it's like a winter wonderland, it was cute, that was Monday morning I think.

[00:07:51] Bob: We have not really gotten any snow. And I think all the stuff that everybody up north is gonna get in the next day or whatever, we're gonna miss it all. It's just rain. 

[00:08:00] Jimmy: Yeah, I just looked at the app and the snow is coming this way. Yeah. Dave, you said it's snowing there now, right? 

[00:08:06] David: Yeah, we are, uh, they're expecting things to shut down later today.

So it just started snowing about an hour ago. 

[00:08:13] Jimmy: Oh boy. Cause the wisp on the map looks as wispy here as it does where you are. So we're probably gonna get the same amount of snow. 

[00:08:20] David: I got a new snowblower this season and I want to use it just one time so I'm hoping I just want to test it out and then I want winter to be over with

[00:08:32] Bob: I saw your video I'm like looking trying to find let me start over I'm trying to find my recommendation video because I have a really good one for today but looking through my history I saw your video on your second channel about unsubscribing yes and I liked it I mean I liked the It was like, it was a clear way to say, like, here are my intentions.

It wasn't, like, sensational, you know, but it was like, here's the intention. I understand that this is not, you know, for everybody. I thought it was really good, so. 

[00:09:02] David: Thank you. Yeah, the, uh, the last video that I put out on my second channel was the engine building video. And it's getting, it's got, like, 1. 8 million views.

And that brought in a lot of new subscribers. But... I think, uh, what I want the channel to be is going to be a disappointment to a lot of those people that came in through that video. And so, the purpose of the video was to say, this is what we're gonna do, um, if you came here for engine building stuff, you're gonna be disappointed, and you can find that content elsewhere.

So, uh, we've got a couple other videos shot for the second channel. I have, uh, this cabinet in the house that I made on the main channel. Uh, a year or so ago and the veneers came off because I did it wrong, so I got a video coming out on how I fixed that. I got a video coming out on, uh, using the resin printer for making little bins for screws and stuff, like why a woodworker would use a little resin printer.

And it goes through super quick. It's just using fusion and printing it out and how it helps me stay organized. And then there's like a couple other little ones. And I just want to, uh, we might do a little vloggy type stuff, like behind the scenes as we're, as we're shooting very low effort type stuff. I don't want to put in a lot of energy cause that channel's not going to make much money.

So I want to focus where. Uh, it's gonna help the business, but there's some things I just want to get out and put out there so they'll go on the second channel. So thank you. 

[00:10:37] Bob: Um, well, let's see, for me... 

[00:10:42] David: I do have some things that I'm working on. 

[00:10:44] Bob: Oh! Yeah, sorry, I got totally distracted. What have you been working on?

So, uh, 

[00:10:49] David: uh, we were... Finish up the lava lamp video and I'll try to show you guys here, but, um, I took an old lava lamp and I gutted it. And then I made this like cocoon type thing out of wood. This is all wood here. Yeah. So that's all carved out on the sides. I got a big hole in the front where the belly of the lamp sticks out on the sides is carved a bunch of little holes for light to shine through part of it's painted.

And then I use clay and epoxy to make it look like lava was Bursting out of the glass onto the table and then I added a light up top so it's a lava lamp plus a regular light and then made a lampshade out of wood and it looks like um like a it's supposed to be like a mushroom spots like a chippy mushroom spot so it's all It's supposed to be very 

[00:11:46] Bob: psychedelic.

This looks like it should be in, like, on the counter of a Mellow Mushroom. Yeah. 

[00:11:51] David: Yeah. Yeah. So that's, uh, 

[00:11:53] Jimmy: that's the purpose. The pizza place. I haven't been there in a while. 

[00:11:57] David: And that project took way too long. For how small it is, it took forever. Like... Yeah, it was, um, there was at least five days of shooting for that.

My bathroom vanity, which is this huge piece, took way less time than it took for this tabletop lamp. So we finished that up, and that video will be next, it's almost, it's almost done. And then we started Rebound. Are you familiar with the tabletop game Rebound? It's like Shuffleboard, but it's got, uh, it banks off the end and comes back around to another lane.

And so I picked one of those up at the Antique Mall a month ago, and I'm remaking that out of wood. And, um, trying to... Trying to respect the original design. So, 'cause it's all plastic and so mine, I'm trying to keep with the original design and, and three d print, uh, the bumpers that go on, the little ball bearings that, that move 

[00:12:53] Jimmy: the ball bearings that are inside the little hockey puck of plastic Exactly.

Are cool. Yeah, I remember 

[00:12:58] David: those. Yeah. And I, um, um, I'm three d printing the, the, the rings, those little bumpers that go on the ball bearings, but then I'm going to use silicon mold to. Make them all at the same time. And I thank you for mentioning a couple weeks ago that resin has to be completely and fully cured before being used in a mold.

So, did a little bit of research there. And, uh, yeah, that's what I'm... I'm really enjoying the, uh, just the remaking ordinary objects into, into other things. It's challenging, and they usually take longer than I expect, but the, the outcome has been very satisfying. 

[00:13:44] Bob: Awesome. Yeah, I'm looking forward to seeing how that game turns out.

I, I had, when you showed that in the video, the plastic version, I don't think I had ever seen that game before. I wasn't, I wasn't familiar with, so. That's cool. We were talking about, on our retreat, we were making up this pool game at the pool table and Anthony was talking about Bumper Pool. Did you ever play Bumper Pool?

Never played Bumper Pool. Oh, man, 

[00:14:09] Jimmy: like... We had a table. My dad always came home with wacky stuff because he's like me, buys junk and when we were kids he had a Bumper Pool table. He got somewhere and it was around for about five years. Then one day it was gone. He bought it and sold 

[00:14:21] Bob: it. Hmm. Yeah, I played a little bit as a kid, and Anthony was saying that he had found one on Marketplace or something, you know, recently, and it's one of those things that It's, David, if you don't know, it's a small pool table with these little posts sticking out of it with rubber bumpers around them, they're circular posts, and then there's holes in the table, if I remember.

They're not on the corner, are they? I think they're in the table. I honestly can't remember. Yeah, it's been a long time, but, you know, it's, you try to get all of... You have your balls in the other hole on the opposite side, but you have to go around the bumpers and stuff. It's just a variation on the game.

Um, but it was one of those things that as soon as we started talking about it, I'm like, oh, how would you make a bumper pool table? Oh, nice. You know, and I don't think I will, but... 

[00:15:06] David: It would go alongside Jimmy's pool table, though. That's true. If you released those both at the same time, they would, they would definitely feed off of each 

[00:15:13] Bob: other.

Yeah. Oh, there's one. Yeah. 

[00:15:16] Jimmy: So it's like a goal at each end. Yeah. 

[00:15:19] Bob: In the middle. A cross in the middle. Yeah, but that'd be a fun one if you're if you're looking for it. We are, 

[00:15:27] David: so, um, I think we've we've mentioned it on the main show here. We are looking for a cottage to buy and to do short term rentals on. A lot of these things that I'm making now are going to end up in that place and I We have a regular pool table here that belonged to my dad, and it never, it never gets used, so we're hoping to find a place that's big enough where we could take the pool table to, and so when people are renting it out, they have things to do, the rebound game is gonna go there, I plan on doing, uh, A Bob Cleggett style arcade cabinet, something that would go in there.

So I want to build a lot of things that are activity based, that people could use when they rent out the cabin. We haven't found a place yet, but we are getting prepared for it. 

[00:16:15] Bob: Awesome. That's cool. Uh, let's see. For me. A couple things. Oh, so, last week. This is just a personal note. Last week I, um... was really missing my white Land Cruiser.

And, you know, it's been out of commission. Still no motor. It's been out of commission since July, I think. Oh, wow. January, July, something like that. And the guy told me it was like, it'll probably be like six weeks. And every time I've called since then, which has been every... Two months. I try not to bother him too much.

He's like, yeah, just waiting on the machine shop. Just waiting on the machine shop there, you know. And then I called him in November and he's like, well, racing season's over. So now they should have more availability. And you know, so mid January, I'm like, I've kind of had enough. Like, I really want my car back.

And so I call the guy with the intention of being like, look, we need to find another machine shop or I'm gonna pay you for your work and I'm gonna take the whole thing back and then I'm gonna go find... I don't know. I'm gonna figure something out. And so I call and he's like, Hey. I'm like, OK. Nothing's happened because he didn't say anything.

So I'm like, well, I, you know, I know that, you know, you said you would let me know when something happened so nothing's happened and I want it. And he was like, oh, actually, yeah, they picked it up like two weeks ago. I'm like, what? And so, apparently, Machineshop has had the motor for two weeks. And said that they usually take three to six weeks to completely rebuild because they machine every surface and they, they do a really great job.

Now you 

[00:17:52] Jimmy: have in the motor, the replacement motor rebuilt? 

[00:17:54] Bob: Yes, not the, the... Which runs already. I believe so, it ran when it came out. 

[00:17:59] Jimmy: Yeah. Yeah. So you're just making sure you're going to have a real chooched up motor. 

[00:18:02] Bob: Yeah. Um, but they'd had it for about two weeks and he said it takes them three to six. So...

Hopefully in another four weeks or so. That's even an extra little... Generous time. 

[00:18:18] Jimmy: Now is the Land Cruiser still sitting in your driveway? Yep. Waiting for its heart transplant? 

[00:18:22] Bob: Yep. Oh boy. Yeah. And I went out the other day and I'm like, OK, cool, like, it's, he's gonna want it soon. I guess I'll charge the battery up just to make sure that the battery's, you know, it's got something in it.

It won't charge because it's been sitting so long. So, I'm gonna have to take it in. It's like a brand new battery, but I'm gonna take it in and make sure that it's fixable. I hope it hasn't drained too far. The word's dead, but whatever. Anyway, it's exciting for me, and I actually had like a legitimate Like, it was like seeing an old friend that you haven't seen in a really long time.

It was that feeling of, oh, man, like, awesome. Like, it's, it's in the near future. And I know that's so silly to have that kind of a feeling about a car, but I don't know. Like it's a, it's a thing that I really enjoy. And so I'm pretty excited that it's almost back. And I think part, half of that is like, that I really liked the car and the other half is.

We've basically been sharing a car for six months, and, you know, even though I have the other green cruiser, it works sometimes. Uh, it, the headlights don't work, so I can't drive it at night. You know, there's, there's like, it's useful, but it's not reliable, and so, I think that's it. The big part of it is just having something reliable again.

What were you going to say, David? 

[00:19:38] David: Well, first of all, we've, uh, we've been sharing a car for about a month now. Kelly's car broke down. She ordered a new car a couple months ago and she was, uh, she had this choice of like paying 1, 500 to get it fixed or just selling it to the dealer and we share a car until her new one comes in.

So, she sold it to the dealer. And so we are just waiting on her new car to, to arrive. So every, every day I'm taking her to work and picking her up and doing. All the errands and stuff, so I can sort of feel what you're going through except minus four kids, but is it, um, does Van Nystedt, does he have a land, is what he drives a land cruiser?

Because I think he took it across the country to go get a new engine or something like that a while 

[00:20:32] Bob: back. Yeah, he's got a 60 series, I believe, and mine are a 40 series and an 80 series, so the white one is an 80 series. 

[00:20:40] David: Gotcha, yeah. So he has a little love affair with, with, with his, Land Cruiser owners love their Land Cruisers.

[00:20:46] Bob: Yes. They really do. And it's weird because, I mean, we've talked about this a bunch of times, but I, In my entire life, I've never been a person that, like, a car is a car, whatever, you know, like, it goes from place to place. And I always kind of laughed at people who were just, like, super into their car. And I don't know what happened, but I kind of get it now.

So, anyway. But I'm excited that that thing is, is in the near future, which is really cool. And I think one of the things that I'm excited about that... Is, once I have a reliable way to get around, I feel like I'll have a little bit more freedom to mess with the green one. Because right now, like, I want to drive the green one to places that I need to get, but I don't want to do anything else.

I don't want to touch anything, because I don't want to make it undriveable, you know, in the short term. So there's like some electrical problems that I, I think I understand how to bypass and, and fix. But I don't want to mess with it, because I don't want to kill it, so. Do you have more cars than 

[00:21:48] David: Jimmy now?

Uh, 

[00:21:50] Bob: I doubt that very seriously. Not per capita, you know, like, per person in my house, absolutely not. 

[00:21:58] Jimmy: That reminds me of, I, so, I've threatened this a couple times already on different podcasts, but in, uh, when, the year I turned 30... I wanted a car, so that was, I'm 55 now, so that's 25 years ago. I wanted a car.

I wanted my dream car. At the time, my dream car was a 76 Eldorado Convertible. So, I pulled together 20, 000 in cash, and I went out and I found one. My buddy, who's a real car nut, he found the perfect car for me in Connecticut. 1976 Eldorado Convertible, and I bought that in 97. 20, 000, it had 1, 200 miles on it when I bought it.

It was brand new, still had the sticker on the window and everything. It was a brand new car that was that many years old. And I bought it from a collector who had ten of them. And I put up to 6, 000 miles on it. So by the time I was done with the car, I was about 7, 000 miles on it. And I sold it to my buddy in 2004 for 20, 000.

And that's the same summer I bought this house. So I used some of that money to buy this house and it was really a no money down buy, but just have an extra cash in my pocket. You know, everything was transitioning. And at the time when I sold that car, it was pretty much all the money I had. I had gotten my last paycheck from the guy who I was consulting with for about a year and a half.

He went out of business, gave me my last paycheck and I sold the car. So I had about 30, 000 in the bank. I bought this house and then. Just struggled until things picked up. Now here it is 18 years later, and the car has become available to me. The family called me and they said, it's time to get rid of this car.

Do you or somebody you know want it? And I was like, I think I might have to take it back. Hmm. I think I have to take it back. Just to keep the world. You have no choice. Yeah. To keep the world right. Right. And it's apparently been garaged, and if I know Peter, the gentleman I sold it to, he probably drove it twice.

This is the kind of guy who is very spontaneous, he wants something and when he gets it he just, he has it and that's it. It's like the thrill of the chase is over. So I'm guessing Peter probably put another thousand miles on it, if that much, I'm guessing. In the 18 years he's had it. Now it's been garaged and it's been sitting and unexercised for 18 years so I don't know what I'm into.

But apparently it still looks the same. And when I gave the car to him it was absolutely showroom condition car. So I don't know, I hope it's close to that still. I haven't heard since. What kind of heard is this again? A 1976 El Dorado convertible. Mm-Hmm. White interior and, and firethorne red with black hubcaps, which was a, it's like, if you see all the, the paperwork from that year, that was the car that they featured in all the, the booklets and the sales samples for that, for that year.

It's red, white, and black. So, 

[00:24:46] Bob: we'll see. I don't know. So, is it like a done deal? I mean, you're saying like, you're saying we'll see, but I don't buy that at all. No, we'll see because I, 

[00:24:52] Jimmy: I, I remember talking to Peter one day at an event. We were together and he goes, Oh, the car's really good. I just, I just replaced all the rubber boots on it.

And I'm like, There's no reason you should have had to do that. He's like, oh no, they deteriorated. And I'm not even lying, like when I gave the car off, the rubber boots is that soft part between the fender and the bumper. In the 70's a lot of the cars had that. It was like the crumple zone so the fender could at least survive a small bump.

And he said he had them all replaced and they looked perfect. So I just didn't understand why they would have needed to be replaced. So now either he had a bump and he didn't want to tell me or I don't know. So that just makes me nervous. So I said, let me see. I asked, uh, his daughter called me and said, send me some pictures when you can, so she will.

The car isn't at their home, it's at a storage unit, so, I don't know, we'll see what happens, we'll see what happens. Yeah. I'll find out soon. And if it's, if it's all, if it's the way I would hope to see it, I might have to get it. I'm compelled. 

[00:25:52] Bob: Are you going to get rid of any trucks or anything? 

[00:25:54] Jimmy: I might, yeah.

I was going to sell a couple of my trucks, and I was going to sell the little green one, and Rob's like, you can't sell that. There's no, like, the one with my name on it, so I'm like, alright, I won't sell it. Yes, 

[00:26:06] Bob: yes you can. You can. Rob's like, no you to point that out, 

[00:26:10] Jimmy: you can. Well, that's another project for the, to maybe the to do list, because, uh, Art Clement, my buddy, Who's an engine head who knows much more about engines than many.

Mostly everybody I ever met. He's like, oh, we'll do an engine swap on it. He goes, it's a six, straight six. He goes, let's put a small block V eight in it. And I go, well, what else? He goes, you have to change the drive train in the rear axle. He goes, but that's easy, . I'm like, oh, okay, okay. I'm like, well, if you hold my hand through it, he goes, I'll do the whole thing.

You just film it. I'm like, okay. Let's do it. Wow. Because we'll do it in your garage. I'm like, okay. I need better friends. So that might be a summer project, maybe. Good 

[00:26:46] Bob: grief. So when I, when I took the Land Cruiser in to get it, you know, figure out what was wrong with it, the guy and I, I told the guy that I found the new engine, new old engine to put in there.

And he was like, well, you know, this is the opportunity for you to do a swap if you want to. And I was like, yeah, I mean, I thought about it, but, like, I don't know what all that would take. And he's like, well, so if you take a, you know, a crate engine and you stick it in there, there's a small adapter you have to do to this thing.

And then you also have to change the transfer case and all the steering, and then all of the electrical is different. So you also have to pull out all of the electrical that goes to the gauges, but then the gauges are analog, so you have to take out all the gauges. And I'm just like... Good grief. No, no, no, no, no, no.

Let's stay old school. Just a straight swap. 

[00:27:32] Jimmy: Be done with it. I just sent you guys a picture from the internet of the exact same thing. Oh yeah, 

[00:27:36] David: that's a drug dealer's car right there. 

[00:27:39] Jimmy: That's exactly what it looked like. It looked like it was right off the brochure. Wow. That's just an internet search.

That's not the same 

[00:27:46] Bob: car. I mean... It's hard for me to imagine you driving, not, I'm not trying to dissuade you at all. I think it's awesome that you have a car you like. But it's hard for me to imagine you driving a car like that around. 

[00:27:57] Jimmy: Well, I used to be Eurotrash. When I lived in the city, I had a garage in the city, and that car was in Manhattan with me.

So, on the weekends, me and my buddies would drive around in that car. Cute girls would just jump right into it, and we'd just drive around, and like, where do you want to go? Oh, let's go to 20th 20th Street. They're like, thanks, this car is so cool. One night, we were outside a restaurant, and I can't remember his name.

He's a guy who won an Oscar. He's an Italian guy, a very funny comedian. He did a movie about the Holocaust, and he won an Oscar. Remember him? It was right when he won the Oscar. We were outside a restaurant, and he walked up, and he goes, he's a beautiful guy. He was the guy who won the Oscar. I can't remember his name.

[00:28:33] Bob: Are you 

[00:28:33] Jimmy: talking about that guy? Uh, not, not the pianist. I don't know. He was a guy who, who did, the movie was about him and his son who were in the, in the Holocaust, in a, in a, in a concentration camp and he used comedy to keep the kids spirit up. Oh. And he wrote and directed the movie and he won the Oscar.

Anyway, that guy, Umberto, Umberti or whatever, he walked over to the car and he was like, Oh my God. And we were like, Oh my God, it's you. And we, we had a little chat. He was really cute. He's a very funny guy in person. But the car was just like, I was always all around Manhattan with it, all around the city.

In fact, my brother, I forget, my brother was at a comedy club the other night. And he said, he saw Tony Rock, and him and Tony Rock are old friends, it's Chris Rock's brother. And he says, he goes, John, how's that car of yours, how's that big beautiful Cadillac of yours? And he goes, I just said it was great.

He must be thinking of me because I was driving around, we had, at the time Tony Rock was doing, this is 20 years ago. And uh, I would drive all around the city and my friend Steve, who knows Tony very well, I go, I must have been driving around with Steve and he, Steve might have, he, Tony probably thought I was you.

He thought, because I vaguely remember one night we were driving around in the East Village and we saw him. So, anyway, and that came up the other day and now my brother's like, why does Tony Rock think I have a Cadillac? I go, because I probably saw him one night in my red Cadillac in the Manhattan. 

[00:29:54] Bob: Man, long story, but what do you get that car and you drive it around with a top down.

Looking at it right now, it says to me that you are the mayor of the place that you live. Mayor, my cheese. So, yes. So, if you get that car, you, I think, are obligated to run for mayor. Or like, yeah. At least mayor. Maybe governor? You could probably be a governor, right? I think 

[00:30:18] Jimmy: you could do that. I'm gonna have to get my own parking spot at the milk run.

[00:30:22] Bob: That'd be so awesome. You could do that. You could just make your own sign, sneak in there one night and just like plant it in the ground and... Mayor McDuresta. Um, well, let's see. So, I have been working on screen printing the last couple days, which is pretty cool. I haven't done any printing in a long time, and this is the first time I've done it on paper.

I've always screen printed t shirts or, like, On to wood, you know, on to projects that have been made. And so this was the first time I decided to kind of redo my old screen printing video, which was very old and out of date, like six or seven years out of date. And this time it was about, um, printing posters and doing multi color.

So it was the first time I had ever done, like, a three screen, you know, poster print. And... The registration that I built into it to get those things lined up didn't work exactly, it didn't come through the way that I wanted it to, so I couldn't register it as, as uniformly, but it actually worked, I think, with the design really well before we came up with this really textural poster design, and it's one of those things where a little bit of an offset print actually makes it look really, really good.

Yeah, 

[00:31:40] Jimmy: sometimes that looks 

[00:31:41] Bob: great. Yeah, so Did some of that printing this past week, which was really fun to do. It was nice to get back to that. Made me kind of want to do more of it, but I don't know, you know, I don't have a lot of time to just like print for the sake of printing, but it was fun to mess with again.

Um, so I did that. Is that 

[00:31:59] Jimmy: for a video? Did you do several posters? Yeah. to offer the posters? 

[00:32:04] Bob: I don't think so. I mean, it's like, it's one of those things that I did maybe ten or twelve. Oh, and 

[00:32:12] Jimmy: then, then do one to 12. They're worth a lot of money, eh? I mean, I don't 

[00:32:15] Bob: know that 

[00:32:16] Jimmy: anybody would want 'em, but No, don't dare you.

[00:32:21] Bob: I mean, they're just like, I don't know. They're just prints. I don't know. They value stuff like that that much, but it was a fun thing to do. And this is great. I'll send you one. How about that? You can, you can resell it. I'll sell it. I'll sell it. , um. So we did that, and then we're working on, we're just beginning to work on a project for a video game that I can't say anything about yet, because it's under NDA.

But, uh, it was a, it's an interesting, man, it's hard to talk about. I probably shouldn't have even brought it up, because I can't say anything about it. 

[00:32:54] Jimmy: What is that game that, what is that game we all get offered? Just say that. 

[00:32:57] Bob: It's not that. It's a, it's a... It's a big video game that anybody that's into the video game will be very excited about the fact that we're doing something for it.

So, we were excited because we got approached about doing this thing, but it turns out they wanted us to make a thing, a physical thing, actually two things, from a video game that doesn't exist and technically can exist in the real world. And so, it wasn't like, here's a hammer, make a hammer that matches the game.

Make a sword that matches the game. It's not like that. It's like... There's a lot of... Huh. Like 

[00:33:32] Jimmy: how? How would you make that? It's like building a dream kind of thing. Yeah, 

[00:33:37] Bob: kind of like that. Building an imaginary concept. So we got some 3D models to start working with, but they are modeled for the game, so they're not high enough resolution, they're not the right scale, they don't have...

the textural stuff that is on the actual item and so we had a big brainstorming session about how to make some mechanics work and some electronics work yesterday to try to emulate what happens in the game but also basically going to have to remodel this entire thing from scratch and it's a We'll talk more about it, you know, as it comes together, but it's an interesting thing to have to get, have to create something that can't exist in the real world in the way that it was originally envisioned.

So, you 

[00:34:20] Jimmy: know, it's funny when I worked at a toy company years ago, we worked at a company that had a model the South Park figures. And we went through the same exact thing because they licensed, they got the licensing deal, the guy I was working with, he got the licensing deal to do all the South Park figurines.

This is in the, in the nineties. And what exactly did the South Park figures look like in 3d? Obviously we see them all now because the toys came out, but in the initial concept, it was, it was hard to imagine what those abstract flat figures look like in the round. And they obviously did a good job, but there was several rounds of modeling.

I'm sure. To interpret that. That's probably more of an easier solution than what you're going through, but we did have to experience that because everyone's like, what does Timmy look like sitting in his wheelchair in 3D? Mm mm. You do have like a front and a side, so it made it a little bit easier, but.

[00:35:13] Bob: Yeah. I mean, I, I, it's something that people do all the time, you know, translating stuff like that to the real world. It's just kind of a new thing for us, and so. It's interesting. A little bit frustrating when we're on a, uh, Kind of tight deadline, so, you know, a lot of stuff to figure out, but, so that's what we're into right now.

Um, I saw that our guitars all sold yesterday. Oh, they did? Yeah, yesterday was the, the drawing, and I didn't win mine. I was a 

[00:35:40] Jimmy: little disappointed. Did somebody win mine? Do you 

[00:35:42] Bob: happen to know? I assume somebody won all of them. I don't know. 

[00:35:46] Jimmy: I gotta get it back then. I gave it to my buddy who's a tech. I was like, this isn't yours to keep.

My buddy Chris has it, so hopefully he didn't sell it. 

[00:35:56] Bob: Yeah, hopefully. That'd be funny if he came back and he was like, Oh, I thought you wanted me to put that on eBay. Yeah, I did that. No, he's got it. Yeah, so they, they did the drawing, all the drawings yesterday. I think they did all of them yesterday. It was on a, like, a live stream.

And mine is going to Arizona or something. And I was bummed because I legitimately... I bought like 30 tickets on my own guitar just so I could try to keep it. Um, partially so I didn't have to ship it, but also just, I liked it and I kinda wanted to keep it. But, I can't. So I gotta send it off. So, I didn't know if you guys watched that, if you knew where yours were going or who got them.

I do not, but I'm 

[00:36:34] David: glad to get it. The case is in my way. There's nowhere for me to put the case. I can hang the guitar on the wall, but the case is in the way. 

[00:36:42] Bob: Yeah, my case is right there on the floor, taking up all that space. Yeah, so the guitar thing, let's see, what else? Uh, I didn't talk about our retreat.

So we went on the retreat, and I... In the previous years when we've done something like that, taking the whole team away, no distractions, have some goals, things that we want to talk about, we've looked ahead pretty much the entire weekend or week or whatever we do. And this year, we looked ahead and we talked about future stuff, but we actually spent a lot more time looking back than we ever have, which was a really interesting thing to do.

Especially if you're a creator, or you, not necessarily a video creator, but if you create something on a regular basis long enough. It, it was really interesting to look back on, we took the previous year's videos, and we went through every video. And we did it a, you know, a month at a time or so, over the course of a few days.

And we brought up the thumbnail, and the title, and it was just like a, okay, what did we do right, what did we do wrong? Kind of thing to look at it and Some of them it was very obvious to be like this just it just didn't work like the idea was not even good enough So we were starting at a disadvantage, you know Like it and then that caused this and that caused this and that caused this other ones were like I mean Mark Rober's in it Of course, it's gonna do well We can't you know We can't say that the video was great or that the title was perfect because Mark Rober's in the thumbnail That's gonna make it have like a ridiculous number of views so some Worked and some didn't work for very obvious reasons But then there are a lot of other ones that were kind of right down the middle and it was really interesting to be like Okay, well while we were shooting this what were the problems or what did we miss or what should we have come back and rethought?

About at the thumbnail stage when we didn't and I think we ended up with some really good insight Looking back at some a few very obvious patterns that came out of you know Like stuff that didn't work because of X And I think, for us, the big things were, we were in a hurry and we were trying to finish it.

I don't even know how many times we said that. Looking back at the previous year's videos. We were in a hurry and we had to get it done. And that made us skip over... Something. It made us skip over thinking about the story ahead of time, or skip over the beauty shots at the end, or skip over coming up with the right thumbnail that actually explained what was happening.

And other things were, we had an idea for what the thumbnail was going to portray at the beginning, we shot the video, and we never went back to reevaluate. The actual presentation, you know, both in text and picture. And so a few things like that, I think were really beneficial to, um, how we're going to move ahead.

[00:39:37] Jimmy: How did you, uh, did you come to any conclusions where the videos that did perform well had the right number of checked? Attributes that gave you high performance? Cause I have a theory, but answer that question first. 

[00:39:51] Bob: I mean, not, not really specifically. I think for, it was pretty, pretty easy to see the ones that did really well.

We could look at the thumbnails and be like, well, yeah, I mean, that's a, like the one with me standing on the shelf. Like it's a dynamic thumbnail just because no matter what you know about shelves. You see somebody standing on something that's floating above other stuff, you're like, well, how? It's gotta be photoshopped.

Yeah, I mean, you either want to disprove it, or you want to understand how something that you don't know. And so, I think there were some things like that, that were just, like, that was the right shot. But then other ones, we, I don't know why it, I have no 

[00:40:28] Jimmy: clue. Because I have this feeling that... I have a feeling that, you know, let's just say, like, the audience is the ocean, and God is the algorithm.

And, uh, you know, if you're fishing for fish, God will give you plenty of fish sometimes, and sometimes he doesn't. And, so... I think no matter what boat you have, no matter what bait you have, no matter what fishing gear you have, if the algorithm doesn't feel like giving you a school of fish to fish over, you have no idea.

So, I feel sometimes that everything checks right that would have been perfect for 2017, but for 2023, the algorithm just isn't feeding you fish. Because, it's just like, you know what, let's put the fish over here today. And so I feel sometimes it's a bit of a futile, futile attempt to try and make everything perfect.

When you're not being fed any fish no matter what you do. Just, it's just, I mean, it's kind of a defeatist attitude and I'm still trudging forward and I'm still doing my, putting my best foot forward but, you know, it's, sometimes it just seems frustrating. Dave? 

[00:41:29] David: So I went through a coaching program with a guy called Daryl Eves.

He's like Mr. Beast's analytics guy. Mr. Beast actually bought him a house so they could be neighbors. How crazy is that, right? So I went through his coaching program and I've been Learning and putting things in place and last week or two weeks ago when we recorded we were talking about views and you guys were like a hundred thousand blah blah blah like yeah my videos rarely go over a hundred thousand views since then my last two videos have gone over a hundred thousand you know the the last video is like 260, 000 so the last two videos have really taken off and The, the two, if, uh, I, I hear all the time, instead of saying algorithm, say audience.

Because the algorithm, all the algorithm wants is for it to feed people what they want to see. The two biggest indicators, more than anything, is the click through rate, and then the percentage watched, 

[00:42:35] Jimmy: or watched. What does that mean, click through rate? I don't know, I never knew what that meant. 

[00:42:38] David: So if you, uh, um, how many pe When people see the thumbnail, do they click on it or not?

So there is a percentage. And if you are getting a higher click through rate, and people are watching all the way through, that tells YouTube, this is a good video, it's going to spread it out to more people. And so those are like the two biggest things and so I had a really high click through rate on the initial video on the last two videos and people are watching you know more longer than usual it doesn't it's not sometimes at the time based thing but sometimes it's just a percentage based thing so if your video is 20 minutes long are they watching up to 15 minutes or whatever and I can see From what I've learned, I can see, I can tell within the first couple days if the video is going to, I usually can tell in the first day if the video is going to do well or not based on those two metrics.

So, um, you know, as, as Bob has probably learned. The whole team is like, it's curiosity in the thumbnail, which is different than what we used to do three years ago, four years ago. How to content was, was big and we all thrived on, this is how you do something. And that's just not connecting with people anymore.

And that's probably for a lot of reasons and people are. In my opinion, people are watching more for entertainment. So, it's more about creating that curiosity. Getting the click and getting people to watch all the way through. So, content has to be good. You're not tricking the algorithm. You actually have to make good content.

But that 

[00:44:22] Bob: thumbnail is the thing that causes the click through. That is the thing. 

[00:44:26] David: If you can't get past that, then the video is... Even no matter how good the video is. 

[00:44:31] Bob: And, and that's a, you know, it's a struggle and we talked a lot about thumbnails and how certain videos it was like, well, the thumbnail didn't work, but what would have worked?

And we brainstormed for a little while about, you know, other options. There's some things that just are not, they're not worth taking a picture of, you know what I mean? Like there's certain things that... It's hard. There's no way to make it really compelling unless you want to jump the shark and go like, you know, photoshopped eyes and googly whatever and like, yeah, it's just not me, so I'm not going to do that.

But, all that to say, it was a really, I think, a helpful time for us to kind of, without the pressure of, we've got to do this because it's got to be released tomorrow, to look back at the videos and say like, what worked, what didn't, make some notes. And so, as we. As we move ahead, now we know that even if we're in a rush, the last step to re evaluate what the thumbnail should be trying to convey is way more important than doing it at the beginning.

Because at the beginning, you can plan, you can hope, you can, you know, try to make sure that you get the shot along the way. At the end, just putting it online with your initial thought is not good enough. Like, it's gotta be, for us, it's gotta be re addressed and like, made to be the right image. Otherwise, the whole thing is gonna fall flat.

It's a lot of effort that just kinda isn't worth it. Yeah. I 

[00:46:01] David: remember, um, I think it was a Collins and Samir interview with... Mark Rober and he was like, we don't shoot the intro at first because we don't know what the outcome of the video is. So a lot of times the intro is shot last. Um, but they have, they go in mine with like, this is what's going to happen, but that's not always what happens.

And, um, it almost gave me the permission to like, yeah, I don't have to worry about the intro right away. Let's let things happen and, and see. And. One of the things that really stuck with me when I was in that program is I was talking about the next video I was going to do with Daryl and, um, and he, his question was, well, how do you YouTubify that?

You know, you're just making something, but how do you, how do you turn that into a YouTube video? He used the word YouTube ify, and so it made me think a little bit different, like, Oh, what is the reason people would watch this? What's compelling about this? Where's the curiosity? How do I turn this into a story, instead of just a linear, like, how to do something?

Like, how does, and how does it fit in the overall... It's scheme or arc or the of the channel, where does this video fit in? So he's like, okay, so if you make this thing, how does it connect to the next video? Is like, are the two related somehow? And it's always like, and it's just, um, I'm trying to think different about, about the videos and it has actually been.

Uh, it's, it's hard. So I'm trying to do these different videos, but I'm having more fun. I'm having way more fun making videos that. Things that nobody else is ever going to make. Nobody's going to make a lava lamp that looks like it's broken and it's spewing lava all over the table. But that was so fun, and I got to use new techniques that I've never used before.

And I'm using tools that I don't care if the audience has because the audience is not going to make this. It's about why I'm making this and the learning and the fun. And so it's really kind of... Giving me a lot of energy into my videos lately. I was, and I think for me I always need, I always need a left turn.

Every couple years something has to happen and I have to take a left turn to bring back that motivation. 

[00:48:21] Bob: Yeah, yeah. I think like with what you're talking about there about YouTubifying something, I think I get the idea. I also think that's kind of like a, kind of a cop out response to... Like a non specific response to, well, you should make it fit the platform.

I think what he was saying was, like, what's the appetite of the audience, and how can you make something present well to meet the appetite of the people who are watching. But, I've heard things like that, or I've heard, like, the same idea with podcast, about how do you podcastify, not those words, but, how do you, and it means, like, how do you reformat something to fit the medium.

I get that. But without concrete, uh, definitions of what the medium requires or is going to work there, That's a, that's a, like if you picked up a brand new creator and you were like, Hey, YouTubify this. Like, what the heck does that mean? I'm not, I'm not digging on Daryl, I don't know him, I don't know any of the training and stuff.

But I think, uh, as, as somebody who's like trying to ingest that and figure out how to actually logistically turn that into something You know, that you can, like, do. I, as I understand it, tell me if I'm wrong here. As I understand it, that means, how do you reformat, how do you tailor, uh, to get the same content in a package that will be immediately digestible by audience X on platform Y.

Is that correct? 

[00:49:56] David: Yeah, I, I, I, I think so. And, I went in with certain expectations and I was wrong. I really thought when I went into this program that it was going to be like, this is how you do something. This is how you tell a story. This is a step by step. And these are the analytics that you look at. But it was more, but I went into it and it's more like.

Asking open ended questions. Uh, where, getting me to come up with the ideas for the videos. Getting me to come up with what I think my audience watches. Because every audience is different. And so, like, when he says something like, How do you YouTubify that? You know, you're not applying a... Formula, uh, an equation.

You, you're, you're trying to figure out what that balance of what you want to make as content and what your audience wants to watch for entertainment or to learn something. So, it was, I didn't know there was gonna be so much thinking involved. I thought I was just gonna take something and then just apply that.

But no, it's like, oh, I gotta, I have to figure this out. 

[00:51:08] Bob: Well, maybe, maybe that term, Maybe that's what he meant by it. Maybe he meant you, specifically. Like, what are the definitions for what that would mean to you and your audience? Because they would be different for me or for anybody else. So, hmm, interesting.

Yeah. Um. Let's see, I had another thing. Oh, another, another thought from us going back through all of these things was we decided to, and I tried to do this last time, but we never actually made it happen, I tried to plan out for the year, we tried to plan out for the year, at least one video For every month, for the entire year, so that we were never scrambling for what's the big thing this month that we should be working on.

It's at least on the horizon, it's at least on the schedule, we can say like, in two months we're gonna do this, whatever. Should we be ordering material for it? You know, do we need to be just... I wish I could do 

[00:52:04] David: that. 

[00:52:04] Bob: Well, I wished we could do it too, and it seemed kind of implausible, but honestly, an afternoon worth of just going through the list, and you know, a lot of the stuff we're going to do this year is add other people's houses on the team, and things that other people are interested in, we're trying to like branch out into those things.

So, kind of brainstorming those things and saying like, okay, well is this project... Is it inside? Because if it's inside, we should do it in the winter. If it's an outside project, we need to do it in the summer or the spring or the fall. And just that simple declaration of like, what time of year should we do this?

Alright, let's put it in June. And then if it has to slip back to July or August, no big deal. There's actually a fair amount of, um, of relief for me, when now, when I look at the schedule, to at least be like, I don't have, you know, 48 weeks. of content to come up with. I have, I have something every month that we can plan on, and then I get to, rather than I have to, I get to fill in the rest of the schedule.

And that's a, a different kind of feeling. I'm actually kind of excited that we did that. And all of it's subject to change, but. 

[00:53:16] David: Yeah. Are these ideas, uh, like, visible? So when people go into the, the office, like, you can constantly see what's gonna happen in July or August and kinda. Let that 

[00:53:28] Bob: stew a little bit in your brains.

We have, uh, we use Airtable for all of our project management and our calendar and all that type of stuff. And so we have the entire year, every week, built out in a big calendar list. And so you can look at that calendar and sort it a bunch of different ways. But we have all those there so we can kind of look ahead and start to plan for them.

We do a weekly meeting where we, we usually talk about, like, production stuff for the next month or so. Cause it's always rolling. But now that we've got that list, we can quickly run through, you know, the next couple of months and be like, alright, is there any work we need to do on that thing in June, or whatever?

[00:54:06] David: I, so, um, I have a question for Jimmy, but before I get to that question for Jimmy, um, I have, over the years, I've just had at least a hundred. 150 ideas for video projects. And a lot of them are like how to do this 10 ways to do this 10, you know, and I've recently thrown out all of those because I have this new idea of how I want to make videos.

And so it feels like I'm out of ideas because I'm starting completely over. Um, and, and I'm not out of ideas. I'm just trying to rethink of how, how I. To make videos, but, um, I thought I remember one time, Jimmy, uh, seeing a door or a wall with like dozens of post it notes. Are you still doing that? 

[00:54:53] Jimmy: Yeah, well, I was doing my New York City shop.

We had the back of the door covered with post it notes. And... I was really bad at updating them. Every once in a while I'd look at them and I'm like, half of those projects are done and published and I'd pull them all down. And then we started, me and Brett tried to do one in this shop and then more recently me and Rob did one on the back of the door with magnets and then I recently collected them all because my traffic pattern, my personal traffic pattern is no longer going to the big shop down the block as much because of the weather.

In the summer I'll go there. because the back shop so now i have this big pack i pulled all the cards off of the back of that door on the magnets and i have them here so every once in a while i just go through and this many is ideas if you notice and there was just like a glitch in the matrix and he just disappeared 

[00:55:37] Bob: that was so crazy like you were there You were there, and then you were not there.

You didn't stand 

[00:55:44] Jimmy: up, you just disappeared. Max Headroom, he disappeared. Um, so I have this pack of cards here, and I have, you know, the blank cards are the ones that don't have the rubber band around them, and the ones with the band are the ones that are filled in. So I'm going through those when I need an idea, and I do want to do a battle board and put them up on the wall, but I just can't decide which wall to do that on.

So, for now, I just keep them in the pack of cards. 

[00:56:06] David: I found, um, you can get blank playing cards. And so, they're the perfect size. So, I'm gonna do somewhat of that, but, um, just have them in slots and I can easily move them around. I've done the digital thing, um, Trello and Airtable, I've done Trello and Airtable and just notes.

I think I need something physical, I need to be able to see it and I need 

[00:56:31] Jimmy: walk by it, because if it's in the app I'll never open the app, that's my problem. 

[00:56:34] Bob: Yeah. I think if it were just me, or, you know, me and somebody else, having a physical thing like that would be great, but with, like, multiple locations, and multiple people, and, you know, it's, we gotta have it centralized.

[00:56:47] Jimmy: And there's always an ongoing list in my notes app. That's just, like, me, like the impulse to write something down, so that's always 

[00:56:53] Bob: there. One of the interesting things that, uh, so in our project management thing, we had it built a certain way, and then, One time last year, Forbian and Josh completely rebuilt it.

They re thought about it and built the entire new structure and then like brought it to me and were like, okay this is how we're doing it now, which is really good. But one of the cool things about it is that it separates content, pieces of content and builds where they can be connected, but they're not necessarily.

And then you have this list of builds That can then be kind of categorized by completeness. And so there's a way to go in here and look at like, here are one line ideas that have no context. You know, it's like where I was typing in my notes. It'd be like, you know, I don't know, some random. Aquarium tube, you know, like, what the heck does that mean?

That's all I had at the moment. And there's other ones that are the title plus some rough ideas, plus some kind of, you know, categories. Is it a woodworking thing? Is it a metalworking thing? Whatever. The stage of it. So you, we can like add details to it. And because it's all digital, we can sort by different levels of completeness.

And so it makes it easy when we're going to put stuff on the schedule. We just go to the list that's like, which ones are at 75%? There they are. Now we can pick from those. We don't pick from the, like, aquarium tube, because it doesn't have enough information to be reliable or realistic. So, you know, there's advantages to...

To that, there's also absolutely advantages to having them on pieces of paper that you can, like, move around, take with you, and whatever. 

[00:58:33] David: I think I just have to change it up every once in a while because I need some sort of pattern interrupt. Because I just get used to one thing and then it becomes, I'm blind to it.

You know, if I see this thing on the wall every day for three years, I no longer see that thing on the wall. And so I gotta do something different. Yeah, that's, 

[00:58:50] Jimmy: that's what happens when I put lists on the wall. So this, having this little pack of cards around me, and then I get intimidated to look through them.

So I'm forcing myself to pick them up and just look through them, because I'm like, Why's that? Because it's just a lot of work. It represents a lot of physical work. 

[00:59:05] David: Is there, is there an anxiety? To seeing 

[00:59:07] Jimmy: them? There's an anxiety to everything. Perfectly honest. You guys know that. It's funny. I had a conversation with my therapist yesterday and he just, he, he said, this is something I need to figure out, but I'll take on a project.

They get excited about it. Then there's this fear of. Oh my God, why did I say yes to this? And then it's like, how am I ever going to do that? And then you look at it and you go, Oh, it's not that big of a deal. And you're like, Oh, that was easy. And you're like, wow, that's done. So that is, that is the creative process.

I saw something recently and I wish I screen grabbed it. Cause it was like, wow, that's a great project. Like the, the four stages of the artist. It's like, wow, that's a great project. Yeah, I'll do that. You're such a piece of garbage. Who do you think you are? Oh my God. Wow, that was great. You know, 

[00:59:49] Bob: it's like, 

[00:59:51] David: I wonder, I wonder if there's a topic in there.

Lessons that we don't learn that we wish we would learn because we don't, we don't learn from that and we just go through the same thing over 

[01:00:02] Jimmy: and over again. Well, that's kind of, I don't remember what conclusion me and my therapist came to, but I was just like, I'm sure I'm just going to do the same thing over and over.

It's what I've been doing for 40 years. You're like, wow, that's awesome. I'll do that. Wow, why did I say I was going to make a third guitar? Oh my god, this is grueling. 

[01:00:17] Bob: Well, I mean, it's funny, like, you can say that loop and it sounds self defeating and stuff, but there's a reason that that's a meme. There's a reason that that is so ubiquitous with creative people that it became a list that got passed around as a joke.

Because that's how people work, you know? Yeah, 

[01:00:35] Jimmy: that's why when my therapist thought that there was some sort of solution to this, I'm like, it's not, this is just how I am. 

[01:00:40] Bob: Yeah, like I don't know that it needs a solution, is what I'm saying. Maybe it does, I don't 

[01:00:43] David: know. Yes, yes. Not all my problems need to be 

[01:00:46] Jimmy: fixed.

Every single time, you know, I'm constantly promoting the idea of stepping out of your comfort zone, and so every time I'm like, Woo, I'll restore a boat that's been sitting in the weather for ten years. Sure. And then again, I'm like, what did I do this for? But you know what, I'm going to be challenged with fifty things that I didn't know or needed to be added to the quote, because now I'm...

We do an open heart surgery on this thing. We literally pulled up the deck last night to see just like mushy wood and like, oh boy. But that's why we challenge ourselves so we get better at problem solving. 

[01:01:16] David: Sure. How many times have you like told somebody, uh, you know, an issue or problem that you're having and then they try to come up with solutions and you're like, no, I don't, that's cool, but I don't want a solution.

[01:01:29] Bob: Absolutely. Absolutely. I hold a lot of stuff in, verbally, for that exact reason. I don't want you to brainstorm something for me. I just haven't gotten to it yet. Or, it's not actually a problem, I just need to get through it. Oh, yeah, totally. I hope I don't do that to you guys, because I probably do. 

[01:01:50] David: I think it's human nature to want to help people solve People's problems.

So I'm sure people have told me things that they're going through and I'm like, Oh, well, you just got to blah, blah, blah, blah. And they're like, they don't want to hear that. 

[01:02:04] Jimmy: I think I'm good at this. I could be wrong, but I think I wait, don't say anything. And then I say. I have an idea. Do you want to hear it?

I don't want to force it on you if you don't want to hear it. Uh, Oh, sure. You know, because then everyone's being like, yeah, yeah, let me hear it. And then they're like, I thought of that. I'm like, yeah, I'll just keep my mouth shut. 

[01:02:22] Bob: Well, Ginny and I have had to do that over the years. I mean, we've been married for almost 21 years and we have gone through all the different variations of like You know, I'm going to say something so that you will help me.

I'm going to say something, I don't want you to help me. You know, all of that. And, of course, I'm not great at it all the time, but I do think that I've, Jimmy, like you have gotten better at just like, she's talking, that means I need to shut up and just listen. And then I will ask her if she wants a response.

And then, you know, try to, you know, like sometimes she just wants to say it out loud, and I need to be there to be said to. Um, so, yeah. It's a practice thing, for sure. Uh, we didn't get to the topic that we were going to talk about, but I think that was good. But we had 

[01:03:02] Jimmy: that topic we were going to talk about in Dave's new one.

Do we remember what it is? Dang it. 

[01:03:07] Bob: I have the first one we were going to talk about. Uh, 

[01:03:10] David: what did we just, what did we just 

[01:03:11] Bob: say? It's recorded, we can go back and listen to it. Yeah, we can go back and listen. We won't, but we could. Well, uh, you guys got anything else on this? 

[01:03:20] Jimmy: Something about a process?

[01:03:21] Bob: Something? Something? It's usually something about process. Problem 

[01:03:25] Jimmy: solving, what did we learn? Nothing? Yeah, um. Write things down. 

[01:03:31] David: Things that we want, we should learn, but we never learn. We keep doing. 

[01:03:36] Bob: Yeah. Okay. I'm gonna write it down. Things. I feel like 

[01:03:40] David: it was said better the first time. 

[01:03:43] Jimmy: Good thing we hit recording it.

Yeah. 

[01:03:46] Bob: Oh, I forgot to hit record. That's all right. Cool. Well, I'm gonna thank our Patreon supporters. Lessons 

[01:03:54] David: we don't learn that we should learn. 

[01:03:57] Bob: That's the title of this one. Yes. I have to write that down again. I already wrote the simpler thing. Lessons. We don't learn, but should. Okay. Uh, big thanks to our Patreon supporters.

We would appreciate it. Very very much. I've got a cool thing to recommend, but I'm gonna let you guys go first. What you got? 

[01:05:32] David: Okay. I'm going to go and I've I've probably recommended them three or four times. I don't care. Andrew Klein.

I just installed the Andrew Klein twin turbo bench vice on my workbench. Oh, awesome. It is a, it is a thing of beauty. It is. It is art. Just to watch all the gears work and all the gears serve a purpose. It's, it's not to look pretty. It's, it's, it has a transmission in there, so it has a high speed and a low speed.

And I got, I bought it last summer and I finally just now installed it. Uh, I, I got. I put my old bench vise on something else that's not in the shop and I've been without a bench vise for six months and it's just been driving me nuts and I've been busy and haven't had a chance and then last week I'm like ah I need to do this right now so let's just get it out let me put it in my way so it's a constant reminder And I, it didn't even take that long to install.

I don't know why I waited so long. It is absolutely, I love it. I love it. And, um, something else that Andrew made is, I don't know how to describe this, but this is a hidden screw. So this looks like a piece of metal and I'm assuming it's cut with EDM. And so it has this, like if you press on there, you can kind of see how that indents.

So it's this special screw takes a special tool. Yeah, it takes a special, uh, tool to un lock that. It locks in with magnets and then I could unscrew this. So, I haven't figured out how to put this into a project, but, uh, it is, he's, he's so brilliant with his ideas and his designs that he deserves to be recommended multiple 

[01:07:22] Jimmy: times.

Yeah. 

[01:07:24] Bob: So that thing you just showed, what is the use case for that? Like, what does he say that's 

[01:07:28] David: for? He, I think in his original video, he's like, I don't know what the use case is. That's, that's up to you guys to figure out. So if, uh, if I built this into a piece of wood and the wood was level with this here, there'd be no way to open this up and get inside or unlock or, or do whatever without that tool.

Wow. Yep. EDM? Is that what, is that the process used to make that, Jimmy? 

[01:07:54] Jimmy: Uh, yeah. Wire, wire, EDM. Yeah. Yep. Um, so I'm gonna, I want to talk a little bit about a couple things. Quickly, the, the pencil sharpening, uh, cavalcata videos, this whole jokey thing about pencil sharpening. I want to give full credit to Keith Drennan and, uh, Uh, The Working Hands Podcast, because they came up with it first.

Keith and Tony came up with it during one of their episodes, and the hashtag is WHPWoodworker, and that's, they started this pencil sharpening thing. Something that came up on one of their episodes, and I saw it going around, and the other night I went to grab a pencil, and I was like, I have to sharpen it, and I'm like, oh.

These guys did this pencil sharpening thing. Let me do one of the videos sharpening my pencil on the table saw. It's a thought that I had every time I saw someone doing a pencil. So I did it and then immediately everyone started doing it. Then I did another one and everyone's doing more and then and now it's becoming credited to me and it's not credited to me.

It's the Working Hands podcast came up with it and I just jumped in late and I revived it. But check that out and you'll see on my Instagram stories. And um, also wanted to also sugge Let everybody know. I did a sticker swap and I got about 300, maybe more. The mail still comes in. Every day at 11, I go and empty my P.

O. box, and there's usually about one inch worth of letters. Every day, um, the, uh, I'm mailing them back out. I'm doing a sticker swap. People give me stickers, I'm giving out the sticker of the stained glass, Makerman. And I'm collecting all those stickers and at the Blackthorn, we're doing a resin. Class, that's going to be, it's in my posts, as of today, as of you guys are going to hear this at this moment.

But I'll be promoting it, it's the end of February at the Blackthorn Makerspace. It's going to be, uh, it's going to be involved with, uh, uh, uh, Total Boat, and Dre, Crafts with Dre is going to be a teacher. But I'm going to do a resin pour of a big table covered with stickers. So we're going to do the Maker Community sticker resin cast table at that event.

So that's it. Just wanna let everybody know. So I'll make a video of it, but that's gonna be happening live during that event. If anybody comes, you could sign up. There's a few class spots left that's at the end of February at the Black Thom Resort. They're making a makerspace Austin, and uh, a couple people on his team are making a makerspace, so we can have classes throughout the winter at the black thorn underneath one of the buildings.

And it's a great makerspace, and I've been helping a little bit out there, so that's it. I'm 

[01:10:30] Bob: done. Very cool. Um, mine is a video that I just randomly ran across, and I've always loved the Ford GT, the car, and so the thumbnail caught my eye. And this video is by Benjamin Workshop. It's got 7. 2 million views.

And it is called 4, 000 Hours to Build My Dream Car in 17 Minutes. So... Oh, I saw that video pop up. Oh my, did you watch it? No, not yet. I, just, mind blowing to me. This guy builds a Ford GT with like a kit body. I mean, he has the, like a fiberglass body for the thing. He builds a Ford GT from scratch. Like, starts with square tube, he has the engine, I don't know where he got the engine, and he has a, like a scan, a 3D scan of the engine, and he brings it into Fusion or whatever he's working in, and he starts modeling the car around this, like, mesh of an engine.

Builds the whole thing out in square tube. And then starts building it, and he ends up with this absolutely beautiful, drivable, fast, finished looking car. I'm 

[01:11:48] David: skimming through it now, this is ridiculous. 

[01:11:50] Bob: You should watch the entire thing, because it's... I was speechless watching it. I don't even understand, you know, how you would...

And, uh, I don't know if I would think that far into it. And, and there's no talking, it's just a time lapse of the thing. So, like, I don't have any idea what his process was, like, where maybe he had tons of help with it, or, you know, there's a community that does this. I have no idea. But, like, I love that car.

It is a, it is a piece of art. It's beautiful. And for him to just start with nothing and get to it, it was... It made me feel like, okay, I can take a Carmagee and rip it down and rebuild it back up. Like, I'm not starting from scratch. 

[01:12:32] David: YouTubers make it look so easy. 

[01:12:35] Bob: Yeah, like I, it gave me a little hope because if somebody can do that, I mean obviously he's got a ton of skill.

And, you know, he uses a lot of different stuff in it, but it is really incredible. I would highly recommend watching it. Um, let's see, the other one is just a buddy of ours, Trustin Trim, Trustin Trimber, Trustin Timber. Yeah. Uh, Peter McKinnon shot a video of him out in the woods doing his thing, building a cabin, and it's a beautiful video, but it was really cool to see him.

Just being, being showcased for doing what he already does. 

[01:13:09] Jimmy: I mean, like, yeah, Truston's amazing. Yeah, Truston came to my New York shop with his wife Eight years ago to come visit. Seven years ago, eight years ago. It's amazing. It's so much time has passed. I 

[01:13:19] Bob: haven't seen him since, uh, Boston, I guess. Yeah, that's we saw him at the 100 thing.

But anyway, it was really cool to see Just, you know, see him get some love on like a big channel and Peter made a Really amazing video about what he does. It's completely silent, there's no talking in it, no music. Um, it was very cool. I gotta 

[01:13:39] Jimmy: check that out, I didn't know Peter 

[01:13:40] Bob: did that. It's 12 minutes long, and it is just quiet, but it's nice.

So, that's what I got. You guys got anything else for today? 

[01:13:50] Jimmy: That's it, I got a, I got a, an interesting thing to tell you guys in the after show. Ooh. 

[01:13:54] Bob: Alright, okay. Awesome. Well, thanks for listening everybody. I'm glad to be back. And, uh, we will see you next week. 

[01:14:02] Jimmy: Thank you. Thank you. Love you.
